@article{rakocinski_responses_1996,
	abstract = {In this study, we examine complex responses by macrobenthic assemblages to extensive beach restoration affecting 7 km of open shoreline at Perdido Key, Florida. Beach restoration consisted of two phases, beach nourishment and profile nourishment, each phase lasting roughly one year. We examined macro- benthic responses using an optimal impact study design incorporating ten macrobenthic surveys completed over a three-year period. This study is important because of its geographical region, its relatively large spatial scale, its long duration, and its consideration of both nearshore assemblages from high energy sandy beaches and diverse assemblages from stable offshore habitats. The physical environment was altered by beach restoration through changes in depth profiles and sediment composition as well as through sediment dynamics. Various macrobenthic responses attributable to beach restoration included: decreased species richness and total density, enhanced fluctuations in those indices, variation in abun- dances of key indicator taxa, and shifts in macrobenthic assemblage structure. One long-term impact of beach nourishment at nearshore stations included the development of macrobenthic assemblages char- acteristic of steep depth profiles. Two long-term negative impacts of beach restoration at offshore stations included one from beach nourishment and another from profile nourishment. After beach nourishment, the macrobenthic assemblage structure changed markedly across a considerable offshore area in concert with increased silt/clay loading. Macrobenthic impacts from silt/clay loading were still evident at the end of the study, more than two years after beach nourishment. Macrobenthic populations fluctuated widely at the farthest seaward stations from apparent sediment disturbance, both during and after profile nourishment. These fluctuations involved total densities, species richness, and densities of key indicator taxa. Macrobenthic fluctuations continued through the end of the study, although profile nourishment was completed for more than one year prior to that time. Considerable macrobenthic recovery was apparent during the study, although macrobenthic recovery remained indeterminate in some places. Long-term macrobenthic impacts at several offshore stations supported the hypothesis that diverse offshore assemblages may be less resilient than contiguous nearshore sandy-beach.},

@article{peterson_multi-year_2014,
	abstract = {Beach nourishment is increasingly used to protect public beach amenity and coastal property from erosion and storm damage. Where beach nourishment uses fill sediments that differ in sedimentology from native beach sands, press disturbances to sandy beach invertebrates and their ecosystem services can occur. How long impacts persist is, however, unclear because monitoring after nourishment typically only extends for several months. Here, monitoring was extended for 3--4 years following each of two spatially separated, replicate nourishment projects using unnaturally coarse sediments. Following both fill events, the contribution to beach sediments of gravel-sized particles and shell fragments was enhanced, and although diminishing through time, remained elevated as compared to control sites at the end of 3--4 years of monitoring, including in the low intertidal and swash zones, where benthic macroinvertebrates concentrate. Consequently, two infaunal invertebrates, haustoriid amphipods and Donax spp., exhibited suppressed densities over the entire post-nourishment period of 3--4 years. Emerita talpoida, by contrast, exhibited lower densities on nourished than control beaches only in the early summer of the first and second years and polychaetes exhibited little response to nourishment. The overall impact to invertebrates of nourishment was matched by multi-year reductions in abundances of their predators. Ghost crab abundances were suppressed on nourished beaches with impacts disappearing only by the fourth summer. Counts of foraging shorebirds were depressed for 4 years after the first project and 2 years after the second project. Our results challenge the view that beach nourishment is environmentally benign by demonstrating that application of unnaturally coarse and shelly sediments can serve as a press disturbance to degrade the beach habitat and its trophic services to shorebirds for 2--4 years. Recognizing that recovery following nourishment can be slow, studies that monitor impacts for only several months are inadequate.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: Underwater irradiance has frequently been cited as one of the most important, if not dominant, factors that regulates the distribution and productivity of seagrasses. Here we test that hypothesis in the development of a model to predict changes
in the biomass of the seagrass \textit{Halodule wrightii} Aschers based on the assumption that light is the dominant factor affecting growth. The model is a time-dependent, mechanistic model developed from above- and below-ground mass-balance and based on
data collected in the Upper Laguna Madre, Texas, over a period of 9 yr from 1989 to 1997; the data set is ideally suited to testing the assumptions of the model. The data include regular measurements of above- and below-ground biomass coupled with
continuous monitoring of underwater irradiance. Although the Upper Laguna suffered from a persistent brown tide from the summer of 1990 through the spring of 1996, the model was successful in reproducing trends in the observed above- and below-ground
biomass. In particular, it captured the rapid recovery of the below-ground biomass as the brown tide bloom declined during spring 1996. Since agreement between the model and data decreases over a period of about 1 yr, some simple data-assimilation
techniques were incorporated to help improve model performance. Close agreement between our model and \textit{in situ} biomass measurements of \textit{H. wrightii} collected over a 9 yr period reflect the importance of underwater light intensity as a major
abiotic factor regulating seagrass productivity. In addition, the success of the model in predicting both above- and below-ground biomass demonstrates the importance of including both compartments in whole-plant modeling efforts that can be applied to
coastal management practices. The demonstrated validity of a predictive whole-plant model for seagrass biomass will provide a valuable tool in the successful management of seagrass resources in coastal areas threatened by decreases in water transparency

@article{foley_guiding_2010,
	abstract = {The declining health of marine ecosystems around the world is evidence that current piecemeal governance is inadequate to successfully support healthy coastal and ocean ecosystems and sustain human uses of the ocean. One proposed solution to this problem is ecosystem-based marine spatial planning (MSP), which is a process that informs the spatial distribution of activities in the ocean so that existing and emerging uses can be maintained, use conflicts reduced, and ecosystem health and services protected and sustained for future generations. Because a key goal of ecosystem-based MSP is to maintain the delivery of ecosystem services that humans want and need, it must be based on ecological principles that articulate the scientifically recognized attributes of healthy, functioning ecosystems. These principles should be incorporated into a decision-making framework with clearly defined targets for these ecological attributes. This paper identifies ecological principles for MSP based on a synthesis of previously suggested and/or operationalized principles, along with recommendations generated by a group of twenty ecologists and marine scientists with diverse backgrounds and perspectives on MSP. The proposed four main ecological principles to guide MSP---maintaining or restoring: native species diversity, habitat diversity and heterogeneity, key species, and connectivity---and two additional guidelines, the need to account for context and uncertainty, must be explicitly taken into account in the planning process. When applied in concert with social, economic, and governance principles, these ecological principles can inform the designation and siting of ocean uses and the management of activities in the ocean to maintain or restore healthy ecosystems, allow delivery of marine ecosystem services, and ensure sustainable economic and social benefits.},

@article{white_ecosystem_2012,
	abstract = {Marine spatial planning (MSP) is an emerging responsibility of resource managers around the United States and elsewhere. A key proposed advantage of MSP is that it makes tradeoffs in resource use and sector (stakeholder group) values explicit, but doing so requires tools to assess tradeoffs. We extended tradeoff analyses from economics to simultaneously assess multiple ecosystem services and the values they provide to sectors using a robust, quantitative, and transparent framework. We used the framework to assess potential conflicts among offshore wind energy, commercial fishing, and whale-watching sectors in Massachusetts and identify and quantify the value from choosing optimal wind farm designs that minimize conflicts among these sectors. Most notably, we show that using MSP over conventional planning could prevent \&gt;\$1 million dollars in losses to the incumbent fishery and whale-watching sectors and could generate \&gt;\$10 billion in extra value to the energy sector. The value of MSP increased with the greater the number of sectors considered and the larger the area under management. Importantly, the framework can be applied even when sectors are not measured in dollars (e.g., conservation). Making tradeoffs explicit improves transparency in decision-making, helps avoid unnecessary conflicts attributable to perceived but weak tradeoffs, and focuses debate on finding the most efficient solutions to mitigate real tradeoffs and maximize sector values. Our analysis demonstrates the utility, feasibility, and value of MSP and provides timely support for the management transitions needed for society to address the challenges of an increasingly crowded ocean environment.},

@article{leslie_value_2018,
	abstract = {Taking the pulse of an ecosystem is not quite as straightforward as taking the pulse of a person, especially when that ecosystem is the Chesapeake Bay. At 195 miles long and 3,237 square miles in area, the size and complexity of the bay's coupled social and ecological systems has challenged efforts to assess its health. Building on more than 30 y of research, Lefcheck et al. (1) offer an innovative way to take the pulse of this much loved and debilitated coastal estuary. By developing a model of the bay ecosystem that brings data from long-term, large-scale monitoring together with knowledge of the mechanisms underlying those patterns, Lefcheck et al. make a compelling case that ecosystem restoration initiatives of the last 30+ y are paying off.The results of Lefcheck et al. (1) show the nutrient reduction enabled by a series of watershed scale agreements over the last three decades are consistent with the observed increase in the bay-wide area of underwater grasses, also known as submersed aquatic vegetation (SAV). SAV is one of the primary sentinels of bay health, and the extent of eelgrass (Zostera marina) and the 15 other species commonly found in different parts of the bay is one of the primary means by which scientists evaluate the effectiveness of nutrient reduction measures and other restoration strategies (2). Based on their results, Lefcheck et al. (1) propose that much of the SAV recovery observed through aerial and on-the-ground surveys over the last 30 y is a direct result of the monumental effort to reduce nutrient inputs and lower nutrient concentrations throughout the bay.Some may be loathe to draw conclusions this bold from a modeling study. However, the scope of the scientific and management challenges in the Chesapeake, as in many other coastal regions worldwide, demands creativity. {\ldots} ↵1Email: heather.leslie\{at\}maine.edu.},

	abstract = {Ecosystems store vast quantities of wealth, but difficulties measuring wealth held in ecosystems prevent its inclusion in accounting systems. Ecosystem-based management endeavors to manage ecosystems holistically. However, ecosystem-based management lacks headline indicators to evaluate performance. We unify the inclusive wealth and ecosystem-based management paradigms, allowing apples-to-apples comparisons between the wealth of the ecosystem and other forms of wealth, while providing a headline performance index for evaluating the performance of ecosystem-based management. We project that the Baltic Sea fishery ecosystem yields increasing stores of wealth over the next 50 y under the ecosystem-based management-inspired multispecies maximum sustainable yield management beginning in 2017, whereas the previous single-species management generally results in declining wealth.We merge inclusive wealth theory with ecosystem-based management (EBM) to address two challenges in the science of sustainable management of ecosystems. First, we generalize natural capital theory to approximate realized shadow prices for multiple interacting natural capital stocks (species) making up an ecosystem. These prices enable ecosystem components to be better included in wealth-based sustainability measures. We show that ecosystems are best envisioned as portfolios of assets, where the portfolio's performance depends on the performance of the underlying assets influenced by their interactions. Second, changes in ecosystem wealth provide an attractive headline index for EBM, regardless of whether ecosystem wealth is ultimately included in a broader wealth index. We apply our approach to the Baltic Sea ecosystem, focusing on the interacting community of three commercially important fish species: cod, herring, and sprat. Our results incorporate supporting services embodied in the shadow price of a species through its trophic interactions. Prey fish have greater shadow prices than expected based on market value, and predatory fish have lower shadow prices than expected based on market value. These results are because correctly measured shadow prices reflect interdependence and limits to substitution. We project that ecosystem wealth in the Baltic Sea fishery ecosystem generally increases conditional on the EBM-inspired multispecies maximum sustainable yield management beginning in 2017, whereas continuing the current single-species management generally results in declining wealth.},

@article{basterretxea_evaluation_2007,
	abstract = {A renourishment strategy for width maintenance of a Mediterranean beach was evaluated using historical aerial photographs and topographic surveys. The 5.5 km Can Picafort beach (Balearic Islands, Spain) consists of urbanised areas with associated anthropogenic pressures, and a Natural Park extending for about 1.5 km where a backshore dune and a lagoon system have been preserved. With the exception of this protected area the beach has been recurrently nourished over the past 20 years using relatively small volumes of sand ({\textless}40 000 m3). Historical shoreline analysis provides evidence of a reduction in shoreline variability since the beach fill program was started in 1987. The last replenishment, in May 2002, provided an opportunity for assessing this nourishment strategy. Longevity estimations based on beach fill performance indicate that partial regenerations have only a limited life span (few years). Moreover, it is suggested that decreased shoreline variability could be a side-effect related to the `extra' amount of sediment supplied to the active beach. Both aspects should be considered in beach nourishment decision-making.},

@inproceedings{gopalakrishnan_adapting_2010,
	abstract = {How is climate change affecting our coastal environment? How can coastal communities adapt to sea level rise and
increased storm risk? These questions have garnered tremendous interest from scientists and policy makers alike, as the dynamic coastal environment is particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Over half the world population lives and works in a coastal zone less than 120 miles wide, thereby being continuously affected by the changes in the coastal environment [6]. Housing markets are directly influenced by the physical processes that
govern coastal systems. Beach towns like Oak Island in North Carolina (NC) face severe erosion, and the tax
assesed value of one coastal property fell by 93\% in 2007 [9]. With almost ninety percent of the sandy beaches in
the US facing moderate to severe erosion [8], coastal communities often intervene to stabilize the shoreline and hold back the sea in order to protect coastal property and infrastructure.

Beach nourishment, which is the process of rebuilding a beach by periodically replacing an eroding section of the
beach with sand dredged from another location, is a policy for erosion control in many parts of the US Atlantic and
Pacific coasts [3]. Beach nourishment projects in the United States are primarily federally funded and implemented
by the Army Corps of Engineers (ACE) after a benefit-cost analysis. Benefits from beach nourishment include
reduction in storm damage and recreational benefits from a wider beach. Costs would include the expected cost of
construction, present value of periodic maintenance, and any external cost such as the environmental cost associated
with a nourishment project (NOAA). Federal appropriations for nourishment totaled \$787 million from 1995 to
2002 [10].

Human interventions to stabilize shorelines and physical coastal dynamics are strongly coupled. The value of the
beach, in the form of storm protection and recreation amenities, is at least partly capitalized into property values. These beach values ultimately influence the benefit-cost analysis in support of shoreline stabilization policy, which, in turn, affects the shoreline dynamics. This paper explores the policy implications of this circularity. With a better understanding of the physical-economic feedbacks, policy makers can more effectively design climate change adaptation strategies. (PDF contains 4 pages)},

This vulnerable area has been subject to a number of beach erosion control measures under the authority of the Fire Island to Montauk Point, New York Beach Erosion and Hurricane Protection (FIMP) project as well as the related Westhampton Interim Project The Westhampton Interim Project, initiated in 1996, provided for beachfill placement, dune construction west of the groin field, periodic beachfill renourishment until 2027, and a tapering of the groins at the western edge of the groin field in order to provide a smooth transition to the downdrift barrier beaches. Project coastal processes monitoring since 1996 has shown that the shoreline position in the project area has been stable and there has been volumetric growth of the dune field west of the groin field. The 10-year average volumetric loss in the project area of 180,000 cubic yards per year is very similar to the 759,000 cubic yards (190,000 cubic yards per year) renourishment volume placed in 2005 after a four-year renourishment cycle. The largest rate of dune growth west of the groin field from initial construction to February 2009 is approximately 2.0 cy/ft-yr while the average rate of growth is 1.25 cy/ft-yr. Good stewardship of the beach and dune system will allow the Westhampton Interim Project to be maintained and provide the storm damage reduction purposes for which it was designed.},

@article{gares_using_2006,
	abstract = {With beach nourishment widely used today to combat shoreline erosion, it is desirable to monitor the post nourishment shoreline to evaluate the projects' success. Implementing a monitoring program is difficult because of time and personnel requirements. Remotely sensed elevation data, in particular that derived from airborne light-detection and ranging (LIDAR) sensors, could be used because of its extensive coverage. In 1998, a beach-fill project was carried out at Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina, and coincidentally LIDAR data were collected annually in this location from 1997 to 2000. This project uses the LIDAR data to identify beach and dune zones and to compute volumetric changes for each zone. Spatial variations are analyzed by examining shoreline segments, in which beach and dune volumes are determined for the different surveys. Spatial and temporal changes in both the beach and dune zones are monitored following the initial fill project. The passage of hurricanes Bonnie and Floyd in the fall of 1998 and 1999, respectively, provided an opportunity to evaluate how the nourishment project was affected by major storms. About two thirds of the initial fill material was removed from the subaerial part of the beach in the first year, probably mostly as a result of the hurricanes. The highest rates of beach sediment loss occurred in the nourishment zones. There was some recovery in the following years. The dune system also changed, both losing and adding sediment in different time periods. The influence of human manipulation of the dune is evident in the cross-shore profiles and the volumetric data. There is little evidence that the fill material moved alongshore to nourish subaerial areas adjacent to nourished zone. Although the nourished beach undoubtedly provided a buffer against the storm waves, poststorm beach recovery was not evident 2 years after the storms, making the long-term success of this project questionable.},

	abstract = {Beach nourishment is a policy used to rebuild eroding beaches with sand dredged from other locations. Previous studies indicate that beach width positively affects coastal property values, but these studies ignore the dynamic features of beaches and the feedback that nourishment has on shoreline retreat. We correct for the resulting attenuation and endogeneity bias in a hedonic property value model by instrumenting for beach width using spatially varying coastal geological features. We find that the beach width coefficient is nearly five times larger than the OLS estimate, suggesting that beach width is a much larger portion of property value than previously thought. We use the empirical results to parameterize a dynamic optimization model of beach nourishment decisions and show that the predicted interval between nourishment projects is closer to what we observe in the data when we use the estimate from the instrumental variables model rather than OLS. As coastal communities adapt to climate change, we find that the long-term net value of coastal residential property can fall by as much as 52\% when erosion rate triples and cost of nourishment sand quadruples.},

	abstract = {Climate change threatens to alter coastline erosion patterns in space and time and coastal communities adapt to these threats with decentralized shoreline stabilization measures. We model interactions between two neighboring towns, and explore welfare implications of spatial-dynamic feedbacks in the coastal zone. When communities are adjacent, the community with a wider beach loses sand to the community with a narrower beach through alongshore sediment transport. Spatial-dynamic feedbacks create incentives for both communities to nourish less, resulting in lower long-run beach width and lower property values in both communities, a result that parallels the classic prisoner's dilemma. Intensifying erosion---consistent with accelerating sea level rise---increases the losses from failure to coordinate. Higher erosion also increases inequality in the distribution of benefits across communities under spatially coordinated management. This disincentive to coordinate suggests the need for higher-level government intervention to address a traditionally local problem. We show that a spatially targeted subsidy can achieve the first best outcome, and explore conditions under which a second-best uniform subsidy leads to small or large losses.},

@article{lazarus_emergent_2011,
	abstract = {Developed coastal areas often exhibit a strong systemic coupling between shoreline dynamics and economic dynamics. "Beach nourishment", a common erosion-control practice, involves mechanically depositing sediment from outside the local littoral system onto an actively eroding shoreline to alter shoreline morphology. Natural sediment-transport processes quickly rework the newly engineered beach, causing further changes to the shoreline that in turn affect subsequent beach-nourishment decisions. To the limited extent that this landscape/economic coupling has been considered, evidence suggests that towns tend to employ spatially myopic economic strategies under which individual towns make isolated decisions that do not account for their neighbors. What happens when an optimization strategy that explicitly ignores spatial interactions is incorporated into a physical model that is spatially dynamic? The long-term attractor that develops for the coupled system (the state and behavior to which the system evolves over time) is unclear. We link an economic model, in which town-manager agents choose economically optimal beach-nourishment intervals according to past observations of their immediate shoreline, to a simplified coastal-dynamics model that includes alongshore sediment transport and background erosion (e.g. from sea-level rise). Simulations suggest that feedbacks between these human and natural coastal processes can generate emergent behaviors. When alongshore sediment transport and spatially myopic nourishment decisions are coupled, increases in the rate of sea-level rise can destabilize economically optimal nourishment practices into a regime characterized by the emergence of chaotic shoreline evolution.},

The widened beach provides increased storm protection to adjacent structures and improved recreational benefits, but is most often transient, requiring on-going, repeated nourishment episodes. Numerical models of beach nourishment typically address such questions as how long a widened beach will last; economic models compare the benefits and costs of preserving a stretch of beach without regard to its geomorphic evolution. Neither have addressed the physical nor economic interactions between adjacent nourishing communities. Here, we couple a numerical model of coastline evolution and a cost-benefit model of beach nourishment, allowing adjacent communities to make dynamic nourishment decisions. Beach nourishment benefits adjacent communities both ``updrift'' and ``downdrift.'' The total amount of money spent on nourishment activities can decrease by as much as 25\% when adjacent communities both conduct on-going nourishment projects, as opposed to the case where each community nourishes in isolation.},

	abstract = {This field study evaluates the effect of nourishing an estuarine beach with gravel to enhance spawning rates by horseshoe crabs. A total of 564 m3 of coarse sand and gravel were emplaced in two 90 m-long treatment segments at Bowers Beach, Delaware, USA from 9 to 11 April 2002. Field data were gathered between 6 April and 24 May 2002 to characterize the two fill segments and the un-nourished segments between them as well as two control segments at the adjacent Ted Harvey Beach. Sediment samples were taken from the foreshore surface and at depth before and after the nourishment. Bay water levels, wave heights, and beach ground water characteristics were monitored over a 12-hour tidal cycle at one of the nourished (15 May 2002) and the unnourished segment (16 May 2002) at Bowers Beach and at one of the control segments at Ted Harvey Beach (21 May 2002) using piezometers and pressure transducers inserted in wells. The beaches were cored to estimate the density of horseshoe crab eggs deposited during the spawning season. Horseshoe crab eggs were buried in pouches at 0.15 to 0.20 m depth for 30 to 40 days to evaluate their survival in developing into embryo or larval stage. Bulk sediment samples were taken to evaluate moisture characteristics near locations where egg pouches were buried. Density of spawning females at Bowers Beach was 1.04 m−2 in 2001 and 1.20 m−2 in 2002. These rates are lower than at Ted Harvey Beach but reveal an increase in spawning while Ted Harvey Beach underwent a considerable decrease (2.63 m−2 to 1.35 m−2). Sediments low on the foreshore remained nearly saturated throughout the tidal cycle at both beaches. The average hydraulic conductivity on the upper foreshore at the non-treatment section at Bowers Beach (0.19 cm s−1) was less than at Ted Harvey Beach (0.27 cm s−1), and the finer, better sorted sediments at depth at Bowers Beach resulted in a higher porosity, creating greater moisture retention potential. Egg development was greatest at mid foreshore at all sites. Eggs at the lower foreshore elevation remained viable, but did not develop to the embryo stage. Between-beach differences were limited to high elevations where higher mortality occurred at Ted Harvey Beach due to desiccation. Adding small amounts of gravel to a sand beach may change the appearance of the surface but may not appreciably increase mean grain size and sorting at depth or the hydraulic conductivity over the spawning season. The pebble fraction may be important for site selection, but finer sizes may be more important for egg survival because of moisture retention.},

Suggestions are made for (1) incorporating natural features and natural dynamism into beach nourishment projects; (2) addressing constraints in size and space; (3) reducing the impact of human actions and elements in the landscape; (4) integrating endangered species programmes; (5) overcoming impediments to implementing restoration projects; (6) conducting post-construction evaluations and actions; (7) obtaining public support; and (8) addressing regulatory issues. Beach nourishment projects can better mimic natural landforms, while protecting infrastructure and habitat, creating space for dunes, and providing sediment for dune building. Dunes can have more value as habitat if sub-environments representative of natural gradients are accommodated. Greater human effort will be required to maintain both dynamic and stable zones for habitat, and these zones may be restricted to smaller scales. Controls can be placed on human actions, such as raking the beach, driving on the beach, walking through the dune, emplacing more structures than necessary and introducing exotic vegetation for landscaping. Regulatory restrictions that now prevent environmentally friendly actions can be eased, and adaptive management and education programmes can be implemented.},

@article{benedet_predicting_2004,
	abstract = {Studies of coastal morphodynamics are becoming increasingly more focused on quantification of relationships between processes, form and function of dynamic landform systems because wave climates (e.g., wave height, wave period, seasonality, cyclical patterns) and sediments (i.e., composition, size, and shape) interact in various ways to collectively produce distinctive types of beaches. This paper identifies criteria and boundary conditions that characterize beaches in terms of morphodynamic states (environmental conditions or energetic stages of development) that produce discrete beach types. Long-term hindcast wave statistics (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Wave Information Study), small-scale aerial photography, cross-shore beach profiles, and beach sediment data from Florida's Atlantic (Delray Beach) and Gulf (Longboat Key) coasts were used as a basis for linking beach morphology with coastal processes. The role of cross-shore sediment variation in classification of beaches is related to prediction of beach types using the dimensionless fall velocity (Ω), the results of which are compared with field observations and morphological interpretation of aerial photographs. A new curve-fitted equation, the morphodynamic boundary condition (MBC), identifies parametric limits that force dissipative or reflective beach conditions when new sediments are artificially placed on the beach (e.g., during beach nourishment programs). Results indicate that the Ω parameter of the new model is strongly influenced by cross-shore selective sorting of bimodal sediments, temporal changes in beach grain size, seasonal wave patterns, and inputs of new sediments to the littoral system. Calculation of Ω using beachface samples produces a bias toward reflective states (decrease in Ω). Sediment samples from bar systems, on the other hand, produce a bias toward dissipative states (increase in Ω). Composite grain size of the active profile is recommended because it more accurately predicts beach states based on Ω (compared to field observation of beach type). The addition of new sediment to beaches requires an understanding of form--process continuums and the MBC equation is a step in that direction. The potential impacts of beach nourishment on beach morphology can be thus determined from local wave data by calculating hypothetical Ω values as a function of changes in beach composite grain size and a constant K value. The MBC equation (Ω=Kdf−2), as applied in planning phases of renourishment projects, can predict changes in beach morphodynamic states, as conditioned by the grain size of the placed fill.},

Nourished beaches should be considered as more than consumptive resources built for shore protection and recreation. Assessments of nourishment projects in the United States are used to identify research needed to address impacts on species and habitats in borrow areas and restoration of natural subenvironments in nourished areas. Achieving these goals involves changes in stakeholder attitudes about the meaning of beach nourishment and development of research initiatives to demonstrate the scientific, technologic, and economic feasibility of methods that are more compatible with maintaining or restoring natural landforms and habitats. Suggestions are made for expanding the spatial and temporal scales of investigation, evaluating alternative beach and sediment types, identifying new uses for fill, evaluating alternative technologies and practices, implementing adaptive management strategies, assessing stakeholder attitudes and capabilities, overcoming cost constraints, and conducting interdisciplinary studies.},

	abstract = {1. Even though beach nourishment is generally considered as an environment-friendly option for coastal protection and beach restoration, sizeable impacts on several beach ecosystem components (microphytobenthos, vascular plants, terrestrial arthropods, marine zoobenthos and avifauna) are described in the literature, as reviewed in this paper. 2. Negative, ecosystem-component specific effects of beach nourishment dominate in the short to medium term, with the size of the impact being determined by (1) activities during the construction phase, (2) the quality and (3) the quantity of the nourishment sand, (4) the timing, place and size of project, and (5) the nourishment technique and strategy applied. Over the long term the speed and degree of ecological recovery largely depend on the physical characteristics of the beach habitat, mainly determined by (1) sediment quality and quantity, (2) the nourishment technique and strategy applied, (3) the place and the size of nourishment and (4) the physical environment prior to nourishment. 3. The limited information available on indirect and cumulative ecological effects indicates that these effects cannot be neglected in an overall impact assessment. Hence, for ecologically good practice of beach nourishment it is advised (1) to choose nourishment sands with a sediment composition comparable to that of the natural sediment, (2) to avoid short-term compaction by ploughing immediately after construction, (3) to execute the nourishment in a period of low beach use by birds and other mobile organisms, (4) to choose a number of smaller projects rather than a single large nourishment project and (5) to select the nourishment technique with respect to the local natural values. 4. In order to allow an objective, scientifically sound, ecological adjustment of future nourishments, research should aim at (1) taking into account the full sandy beach ecosystem, (2) avoiding strategic imperfections in experimental design and (3) elucidating the biological processes behind impact and recovery of all ecosystem components.

@article{blott_morphological_2004,
	abstract = {Beach nourishment is increasingly seen as an appropriate management solution in areas which are experiencing beach erosion. Such a scheme has been implemented along the Lincolnshire coast between Skegness and Mablethorpe, on the east coast of England, since 1994. Poorly sorted, gravelly sandy sediment has been placed on the beaches in a gently sloping seaward profile to raise beach levels and protect the hard defences from wave attack. Grain size analysis of beach sediments, topographic profiling and remote sensing have been used to monitor the beach response. After nourishment, wave reworking caused a rapid redistribution of sediment over the beach profile during the succeeding weeks. Coarse sediment has remained on the beach berm, while finer sediment has migrated to the lower beach and sub-tidal zone. The berm face has correspondingly become steeper, producing more wave reflectance, and further scour and erosion of lower beach sediment, although there appears to have been little alongshore sediment transport. The most severe sediment loss has occurred around promontories and on the central portion of the convex-shaped coast which experiences greatest wave exposure. While the nourishment scheme has improved the standard of defence, further sediment losses could be reduced by nourishing the beach with a more natural size grading, promoting a flatter beach profile and increasing the dissipation of wave energy. Unless stabilization of the beach profile can be achieved, further periodic renourishment will be required to maintain},

@techreport{greene_beach_2002,
	abstract = {Many beaches along the east coast of the United States are eroding, which threatens habitat,property, public infrastructure, and the tourist industry.  Loss of sand can be attributed to naturalfactors such as storms, sea level changes, waves, currents, tides, wind, bathymetry, shorelinegeology, sand supply and quality, and sand movement among dunes, beach, and offshore bars(Bird, 1983; NRC, 1990a).  Shortages of sediment can also arise from man-made activitiesincluding construction of harbors, groins, jetties, and seawalls; shoreline development; dredgingof tidal inlets; damming of rivers; and beach nourishment (London et al., 1981; Kana, 1988;NRC, 1990).Of all the forces that contribute to erosion, sea level rise is one of the major global concerns thatwill likely affect coastlines throughout the world in the coming years. Sea level is estimated torise approximately 20 cm by the year 2050 (IPCC, 1996), which translates to an average of 1meter of shoreline erosion per year (Leatherman et al., 2000).  Some sources estimate the totalU.S. shoreline subjected to erosion will be close to 80\%, while others put the total at 100\%, ifstable or accreting shorelines are considered short-lived (Pilkey and Dixon, 1996).  Some areaswill experience greater impacts than others from sea-level rise, due to local geologic rise or fallof land areas relative to global sea level changes, local geological structures, and other factors.Coastlines move in response to many of the natural forces that simultaneously act upon them inan attempt to maintain equilibrium (Williams, 2001).  Shoreline erosion can lead to a loss ofhabitat for sea turtles, birds, fish, plants, and a host of other organisms that use the beach duringsome portion, or all, of their life cycle.  Along barrier islands, shoreline erosion could moreaccurately be termed ``shoreline retreat,'' because the beach is not actually eroding, but is movinglandward in response to a rising sea level (Pilkey, 1996).  This concept applies when the barrierisland is able to retreat, and there is simultaneous sand accretion on the sound side of the island.In situations where the shorefront is unable to migrate landward, the term ``shoreline erosion''would be accurate.  In the Mid-Atlantic Region, barrier beaches migrate in a north-southdirection (Dixon and Pilkey, 1991).Erosion is also problematic when there are structures that lie in harm's way, which requireprotection against impending waves and sea level rise (Pilkey, 1996).  Man has attempted to haltretreating shorelines for decades in an effort to save these structures.  The first documentedbeach nourishment project took place in this country during 1922-1923 at Coney Island, NewYork (Farley, 1923).  During the 1930's, the federal government became involved in duneconstruction activities along the Outer Banks of North Carolina.  It was not until 1962, followingthe devastating Ash Wednesday storm that caused severe damage from Florida to New England,that the first congressionally-authorized beach nourishment project was undertaken by the U.S.Army Corps of Engineers (``Army Corps,'' or ``Corps'').  By 1987, over 400 miles of U.S.shoreline had undergone beach nourishment, using at least 400 million cubic yards of sand in theprocess (Pilkey and Dixon, 1996).
2The 21st century will likely witness increased beach nourishment activity as more coastal townsand cities use this management approach.  If done properly, it can effectively safeguard coastalstructures, restore habitat, and provide a wider recreational area for beachgoers.  Unfortunately,there are still many uncertainties concerning effects to the marine and beach environment.  Somestates have conducted more environmental monitoring than others have, but the effects to manytaxa are yet unevaluated.  Monitoring studies are often based on unreplicated field surveys, havenot been peer reviewed by third parties, and are not published in scientific journals (Lindeman etal., 2000).  The impacts to fish and their habitat are still poorly understood and cumulativeeffects are inadequately addressed.  The Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (ASMFC)has a strong interest in protecting the 22 fish species they manage against any negative impactsthat may result from beach nourishment.Since the frequency of beach nourishment projects is expected to increase in the future, it isworthwhile to review the current level of knowledge regarding impacts and to identify areaswhere information is lacking.This paper outlines the basic issues surrounding beachnourishment: 1) coastal erosion and possible management approaches; 2) how beachnourishment is carried out; 3) federal and state activities; 4) the environmental effects at the minesite and the target beach; 5) research needs; and 6) recommendations for improving monitoringstudies.  Some of the issues discussed in the mine site section may also be applicable to the targetbeach section (and vice versa) in instances where habitat and species are the same.  To avoidrepetition, the key points are usually discussed in only one section.Various monitoring studies have been conducted over the years, with impacts ranging fromessentially benign, to long-term consequences to the marine environment.  The majority of eastcoast beach nourishment studies conducted to date, have taken place in the Southeast and there isa need to carry out more studies in the Mid-Atlantic and the Northeast region.This paper willreview major studies that have concluded insignificant impacts, with a brief discussion of thefindings.  Those beach nourishment studies that have found the effects to be more serious, ornon-beach nourishment studies and laboratory experiments whose results suggest potentialimpacts, may be discussed in greater detail.  This will allow state's the opportunity to follow upon studies that may be pertinent to their locale.This information will provide states with a basic understanding of what beach nourishment is,the level of each state's involvement, and how these activities are affecting the marine and beachenvironment.  If these actions are deemed to be having possible deleterious effects onCommission-managed species and their habitat, the Habitat Program may respond by developingmeasures to address these problems.  Finally, this paper can serve to educate the general publicand provide sources that can be further examined to gain an in-depth knowledge of beachnourishment.},

	abstract = {One of the most certain consequences of global warming is an increase of global (eustatic) sea level. The resulting inundation from rising seas will heavily impact low-lying areas; at least 100 million persons live within one meter of mean sea level and are at increased risk in the coming decades. The very existence of some island states and deltaic coasts is threatened by sea level rise. An additional threat affecting some of the most heavily developed and economically valuable real estate will come from an exacerbation of sandy beach erosion. As the beach is lost, fixed structures nearby are increasingly exposed to the direct impact of storm waves, and will ultimately be damaged or destroyed unless expensive protective measures are taken. It has long been speculated that the underlying rate of long-term sandy beach erosion is two orders of magnitude greater than the rate of rise of sea level, so that any significant increase of sea level has dire consequences for coastal inhabitants. We present in this paper an analytical treatment that indicates there is a highly multiplicative association between long-term sandy beach erosion and sea level rise, and use a large and consistent data base of shoreline position field data to show that there is reasonable quantitative agreement with observations of 19th and 20th century sea levels and coastal erosion. This result means that the already-severe coastal erosion problems witnessed in the 20th century will be exacerbated in the 21st century under plausible global warming scenarios.},

	abstract = {Utilizing the Cornell University Long and Intermediate WAVE (COULWAVE) Boussinesq wave model, the effect of theconstruction of a conventional beach nourishment project in Surf City, New Jersey, on the quality of the local surf breakis examined in detail. A 20-year-long nearshore synthetic wave record is first developed for use in creating a monthlywave climate``almanac''so that typical seasonal effects on surf-break quality can be objectively portrayed. The wavemodel is then run with preconstruction bathymetric conditions, and with three postconstruction surveys performed insubsequent months. Construction of the nourishment project was found to affect the quality of the surf break adverselyby (1) compression of the surf zone, (2) an increase in the occurrence of``closeouts,''(3) a shift in breaker type towardcollapsing breakers, particularly during high tide, and (4) an increase in wave reflection---findings that are in agreementwith  anecdotal  testimony  offered  by  local  surfers.  On  the  basis  of  modeling  results  conducted  using  the  sequentialpostconstruction surveys and the wave almanac, it appears to have required nominally 21--22 months for the surf-breakquality to return to preproject conditions. A paradigm shift in the design and construction of beach nourishment projectsin the United States is required if such effects are to be avoided, and several options are offered and discussed.},

	abstract = {In this study, we estimate the shoreline retreat, the vulnerability and the erosion rates of an open beach-dune system under projected sea level rise (SLR) and the action of wind-waves (separately and in combination). The methodology is based on the combination of two state-of-the-art numerical models (XBeach and Q2D-morfo) applied in a probabilistic framework and it is implemented in an open sandy beach in Menorca Island (Western Mediterranean). We compute the shoreline response to SLR during the 21st century and we assess the changing impacts of storm waves on the aerial beach-dune system. Results demonstrate the relevant role that the beach backshore features, such as the berm, play as coastal defense, reducing the shoreline retreat and dune vulnerability rates in the near-term (a few decades ahead) and highlighting the importance of simulating the beach morphodynamic processes in coastal impacts assessments. Our findings point at SLR as the major driver of the projected impacts over the beach-dune system, leading to an increase of ∼25\% of the volume eroded due to storm waves by the end of the century with respect to present-day conditions.},

@article{idier_vulnerability_2013,
	abstract = {The main objective of the VULSACO (VULnerability of SAndy COasts to climate change and anthropic pressure) project was to investigate present day and potential future vulnerability of sandy coasts at the 2030 horizon, i.e. on a time scale related to climate variability. The method, based on a multidisciplinary approach bringing together geologists, geographers, physicists, social psychologists, engineers and stakeholders, was structured around 4 axes: field data analysis; numerical modelling; analysis of governance and stakeholder perceptions; and development of vulnerability indexes. This approach was designed to investigate vulnerability at a local scale and was applied to 4 contrasting beaches located in France: S{\`e}te Lido (Mediterranean Sea), Truc Vert and La Tresson beaches (Atlantic Ocean), and Dewulf (English Channel). The results focus on decadal and multi-annual beach trends at the Truc Vert beach site. There is almost no trend in beach volume at Truc Vert beach, although there is a variation in this parameter on a cycle of 2 to 3 yr, with variations related to wave energy and probably to indexes of climate variability. Numerical modelling identified the sensitivity of beach responses to changes in wave height and direction, especially in terms of subtidal morphology and the potential development of shoreline instability. Together with the observed offshore wave angle at the Biscay Buoy, these model results suggest that a potential change in wave angle due to climate variability could significantly modify the bars' morphology. The combination of data analysis and numerical modelling contributed to the development of vulnerability indexes designed for sandy coasts, which take into account climate-dependant variables such as waves. This allowed the differentiation of the sites in terms of vulnerability to erosion: S{\`e}te Lido and Truc Vert beach were the most and least vulnerable sites, respectively. These indexes help in identifying the dominant components of beach vulnerability, and provide potential for the study of how anthropogenic factors affect vulnerability. The study of stakeholder perceptions and decision-making with regard to climate-related risk  also highlighted potential anthropogenic effects on beach vulnerability, and identified possible site-specific outcomes.},

Climate change (CC) driven variations in these environmental forcings will inevitably have a profound effect on the coastal zone. Given the continued growth of coastal communities and extremely high value of coastal assets worldwide, effective adaptation measures underpinned by reliable coastal CC impact assessments are essential to avoid massive future coastal zone losses. This review aims to promote the adoption of best practice in local scale assessments of potential physical impacts of CC on open sandy coasts by (a) summarising the potential first order physical impacts of CC, (b) suggesting a standard modelling framework for local scale CC impact assessments, (c) identifying future research needs to facilitate the effective implementation of the prescribed modelling framework, (d) suggesting ways to address the identified research needs, and (e) discussing how existing methods/tools may be used for CC impact assessments until more advanced methods/tools are developed.},

	abstract = {Coastal hazards involve the interaction or effects of natural coastal processes on shoreline development, infrastructure,and human activities. Future sea-level rise will affect California's coastal development and infrastructure through bothflooding of low-lying areas and erosion of cliffs, bluffs, and dunes. The global rate of sea-level rise is increasing and manylow-lying developed shoreline areas are already experiencing flooding at extreme high tides, particularly during periodsof large storm waves. The combined effects of short-term extreme wave and tide events and the global rate of sea levelincrease will present greater risks in the near future for coastal California. Protecting private development and publicinfrastructure along shorelines has become a pressing issue for many coastal communities and the state, with a limitednumber of management options, each with their own costs, benefits, and effects. These options include: do nothing, beachnourishment, hard armoring structures, living or green shorelines, and managed retreat or relocation. Hard armoringstructures such as seawalls and revetments have been the typical historical response to coastal erosion, and in 1971, just2.5\% of California's entire 1760-km shoreline was armored. By 2018, armor totals reached 13.9\% of the entire state'scoastline, a 5.5-fold increase over 47 years. None of the past or present efforts to protect shoreline development andinfrastructure from coastal storm damage and shoreline erosion will be effective over the long term with rising sea levels.A growing awareness of the cumulative effects of armoring the shoreline has led the California Coastal Commission totake an increasingly critical look at any new proposals for coastal armoring.},

@article{hartog_mechanisms_2008,
	abstract = {Since 1973, Delray Beach, located on the southeast coast of Florida, U.S.A. has been periodically nourished. The morphological evolution of these nourishments has been influenced by design aspects (e.g., changes in shoreline orientation), extreme events (hurricanes, northeastern storms), and dredging of offshore borrow areas created to provide the nourishment sediments. This paper describes a thorough analysis of the physical processes influencing nourishment performance using the process-based model Delft3D. The analysis distinguishes three steps: (1) a wave analysis, (2) a hydrodynamic analysis, and (3) a morphological analysis. The wave analysis shows that the oldest, deeper, borrow pits (dredged in 1973 and 1978) have the largest effect on the nearshore wave climate, while the effects of the reefs can be considered negligible. Results from the hydrodynamic analysis indicate that differences in wave height cause variations in alongshore current velocities related to differences in wave setup and local wave angle. The morphologic analysis also shows a large influence of the older borrows on fill performance. Bar formation behind the borrows is predicted by the model; however, this feature couldn't be confirmed with 300-m spaced beach profile data. Higher current velocities were predicted in the shadow zone behind borrow areas because of gradients in wave-induced water levels and changes in wave direction induced by the borrows. The higher than average erosion in the southern end of the fill appears to be caused by changes in shoreline orientation and to a lesser degree, borrow area effects. Modeling played a key role in understanding the observed morphological development of the fill. The use of different bathymetric scenarios proved to be a useful method in isolating the physical processes relevant to nourishment performance and assessing their relative effects.

@article{hoagland_costs_2012,
	abstract = {Most existing studies of beach replenishments make approximations or use rules-of-thumb for the cost of the volume of material applied or the cost per length of shoreline. Using published historical data from the US Atlantic coast, we develop a statistical model of the costs of beach replenishment episodes. The model can be used to evaluate the costs of replenishment as a function of the volume of material, the beach length, the episode location, the year, the type of episode, and the source of funding. Although it has been observed that beach replenishment activities are small and declining in number in some areas, such as in New England, we expect that future coastal erosion expected from changes in sea levels as exacerbated by storm events eventually may lead to increased attention to the use of beach replenishment as a "soft" structural response. It is critical for coastal planners to compare sound estimates of the costs of soft structures to the costs of alternative responses, including hard structures, retreat, and abandonment.

The coastline changes along the beach are studied by means of satellite image analyses and from this, the areas with most erosion and the rates of beach erosion and accretion are computed. The degree of anthropization is determined from land use maps and changes in vegetation cover. The results of this case study show that the construction of a groin has produced an area of beach growth, 70,933 m2 updrift, but an area loss, 17,001 m2 downdrift, with an average annual rate change of -0.17 m. It was found that 85\% of the study area is still in a conserved state, 14\% has a low level of alteration and only 1\% can be considered highly altered (urbanized areas). This work also suggests alternative solutions for minimizing the beach erosion, using hybrid and/or soft solutions.},

The annual average rate of erosion found is of -3.70 m, while the net shore transport annual average rate found is of -10.55 m. Finally, three intervention alternatives are proposed and tested numerically: (a) ``do nothing'', (b) removal of structures and (c) beach nourishment. It was found that a soft intervention combined with de-engineering would be the best option to recover the beach stability and strengthen the ecosystem connectivity and services.},

Such beach ``nourishment'' can bury shallow reefs and degrade other beach habitats, depressing nesting in sea turtles and reducing the densities of invertebrate prey for shorebirds, surf fishes, and crabs. Despite decades of agency-mandated monitoring at great expense, much uncertainty about the biological impacts of beach nourishment nonetheless exists. A review of 46 beach monitoring studies shows that (a) only 11 percent of the studies controlled for both natural spatial and temporal variation in their analyses, (b) 56 percent reached conclusions that were not adequately supported, and (c) 49 percent failed to meet publication standards for citation and synthesis of related work. Monitoring is typically conducted through project promoters, with no independent peer review, and the permitting agencies exhibit inadequate expertise to review biostatistical designs.

@article{wilber_suspended_2006,
	abstract = {The potential biological effects of elevated suspended sediment concentrations caused by beach nourishment activities are a commonly cited environmental concern; however, the spatial scope and magnitude of increases in total suspended sediment (TSS) levels are infrequently monitored. In this study, suspended sediment conditions were monitored for two nourishment events on the northern coast of New Jersey in 1997 and 1998. Samples were taken in the swash, surf, and nearshore zones near the discharge pipe and at reference areas both north and south of the fill sites. Sampling was also conducted after two major storms passed through the area in September 1999 (the remnants of Hurricanes Dennis and Floyd). For both nourishment events, swash zone suspended sediment concentrations were significantly higher at sites of active discharge and recently nourished stations than at unnourished stations; however, no differences in TSS concentrations were detected between nourished and unnourished stations in the surf zone and nearshore habitats during either nourishment event. Maximum bottom surf zone and nearshore TSS concentrations related to nourishment activities were 64 mg/L and 34 mg/L, respectively, compared with respective maximum bottom concentrations of 81 mg/L and 425 mg/L after storms. Background maximum bottom TSS concentrations in the surf and nearshore zones on unnourished portions of the beach were less than 20 mg/L. Elevated TSS concentrations associated with the active beach nourishment site were limited to within 400 m of the discharge pipe in the swash zone. More direct monitoring of TSS concentrations is needed to better understand the potential biological effects of beach nourishment activities.},

@article{montague_recovering_2008,
	abstract = {A sand deficit on Florida's Atlantic coast affects sea turtle nesting, dune ecosystems, and storm protection. Ecological benefits of restoring very large deficits could exceed ecological costs. Dredging and beach nourishment databases revealed sand disposal dynamics and deficit size. Dredge-and-fill activities increased after 1950, peaked in the 1980s, then declined somewhat. Most sand disposal accompanied channel and harbor deepening; little was primarily for beach nourishment. Until the 1970s most dredged material was placed outside the coastal sand-sharing system (offshore and upland). After 1970, beach and nearshore disposal rapidly increased, but generally involved sand already within the system. Moreover, offshore and upland disposal did not immediately decline. To date, little sand has been returned. By 2003, net removal totaled 130 × 10{\textasciicircum}sup 6{\textasciicircum} m{\textasciicircum}sup 3{\textasciicircum}. Channels and harbors increased by 70 × 10{\textasciicircum}sup 6{\textasciicircum} m{\textasciicircum}sup 3{\textasciicircum}, leaving 60 × 10{\textasciicircum}sup 6{\textasciicircum} m{\textasciicircum}sup 3{\textasciicircum} of standing sand deficit. Jetties could have redistributed another 70 × 10{\textasciicircum}sup 6{\textasciicircum} m{\textasciicircum}sup 3{\textasciicircum} from beaches and dunes to inlet shoals. Overall, loss of beaches and dunes could approach 130 × 10{\textasciicircum}sup 6{\textasciicircum} m{\textasciicircum}sup 3{\textasciicircum}. Engineering responses to past objections have improved both habitat suitability and longevity of nourished beaches. Through field trials and adaptive management principles, ecologists could now develop beach nourishment into a management tool to rebuild lost habitat, restore the sand deficit, and stockpile additional sand before nonessential channels and harbors are allowed to refill. With large projects, sand from offshore, upland, and ebb shoal sites and natural wave energy for stable beach building, beach and dune habitat can be restored within decades, better preparing threatened animals for rising sea level.

	abstract = {Storms can have a large impact on sandy shores, with powerful waves eroding large volumes of sand off the beach. Resulting damage to the physical environment has been well-studied but the ecological implications of these natural phenomena are less known. Since climate change predictions suggest an increase in storminess in the near future, understanding these ecological implications is vital if sandy shores are to be proactively managed for resilience. Here, we report on an opportunistic experiment that tests the a priori expectation that storms impact beach macrofaunal communities by modifying natural patterns of beach morphodynamics. Two sites at Sardinia Bay, South Africa, were sampled for macrofauna and physical descriptors following standard sampling methods. This sampling took place five times at three- to four-month intervals between April 2008 and August 2009. The second and last sampling events were undertaken after unusually large storms, the first of which was sufficiently large to transform one site from a sandy beach into a mixed shore for the first time in living memory. A range of univariate (linear mixed-effects models) and multivariate (e.g. non-metric multidimensional scaling, PERMANOVA) methods were employed to describe trends in the time series, and to explore the likelihood of possible explanatory mechanisms. Macrofaunal communities at the dune-backed beach (Site 2) withstood the effects of the first storm but were altered significantly by the second storm. In contrast, macrofauna communities at Site 1, where the supralittoral had been anthropogenically modified so that exchange of sediments with the beach was limited, were strongly affected by the first storm and showed little recovery over the study period. In line with predictions from ecological theory, beach morphodynamics was found to be a strong driver of temporal patterns in the macrofaunal community structure, with the storm events also identified as a significant factor, likely because of their direct effects on beach morphodynamics. Our results also support those of other studies suggesting that developed shores are more impacted by storms than are undeveloped shores. Whilst recognising we cannot generalise too far beyond our limited study, our results contribute to the growing body of evidence that interactions between sea-level rise, increasing storminess and the expansion of anthropogenic modifications to the shoreline will place functional beach ecosystems under severe pressure over the forthcoming decades and we therefore encourage further, formal testing of these concepts.},

Coastal erosion, assessed through Landsat images, showed a net sediment deficit of 0.94km2 of land loss along this beach. An integrated study was undertaken aiming to detect submarine relict sand deposits available for beach nourishment, to estimate the total excavated and dry sediment volumes, to assess the post-nourishment longshore sand transport and to evaluate the related environmental implications. Results showed that available sediment volume extracted from the sandbank may range from 5×106to4.3×107m3, increasing beach width from 52 to 450 m, respectively. Post-nourishment longshore sediment transport volumes could reach 1.34×106 m3 yr1 at the exposed eastern part of the beach, diminishing rapidly to 2.91×105 m3 yr1 at its sheltered part, implying that beach restoration could last up to 33 years before sand is completely lost.},

	abstract = {A new experimental campaign on a 2D movable-bed physical model, reproducing a typical nourishment sandy beach profile, is being carried out in the wave flume of the Laboratory of Coastal Engineering at Politecnico di Bari (Bari, Italy). The main aim is to assess the short-term evolution of a sandy beach nourishment, relying on a mixed solution built on the deployment of a Beach Drainage System (BDS) and a rubble-mound detached submerged breakwater. This paper aims at illustrating the experimental findings. Tests presented herein deal with both unprotected and protected configurations, focusing on the hydrodynamic and morphodynamic processes under erosive conditions. Results show that, with respect to the unprotected conditions, BDS reduces the shoreline retreat and the beach steepen within swash and surf zone as well. Moreover, a reduction of net sediment transport rate is observed. When BDS is coupled with the submerged sill, a reversal of the prevalent direction of the net sediment transport seaward occurs offshore the sheltered region. Less considerable positive effects on shoreline retreat are induced by the submerged structure, whereas the mean beach slope remains quite stable. Secondary effects of drain on the submerged sill performance are also highlighted. BDS reduces wave-induced setup on beach, by mitigating the mean water level raising, typically experienced by such structures.},

@article{defeo_threats_2009,
	abstract = {We provide a brief synopsis of the unique physical and ecological attributes of sandy beach ecosystems and review the main anthropogenic pressures acting on the world's single largest type of open shoreline. Threats to beaches arise from a range of stressors which span a spectrum of impact scales from localised effects (e.g. trampling) to a truly global reach (e.g. sea-level rise). These pressures act at multiple temporal and spatial scales, translating into ecological impacts that are manifested across several dimensions in time and space so that today almost every beach on every coastline is threatened by human activities. Press disturbances (whatever the impact source involved) are becoming increasingly common, operating on time scales of years to decades. However, long-term data sets that describe either the natural dynamics of beach systems or the human impacts on beaches are scarce and fragmentary. A top priority is to implement long-term field experiments and monitoring programmes that quantify the dynamics of key ecological attributes on sandy beaches. Because of the inertia associated with global climate change and human population growth, no realistic management scenario will alleviate these threats in the short term. The immediate priority is to avoid further development of coastal areas likely to be directly impacted by retreating shorelines. There is also scope for improvement in experimental design to better distinguish natural variability from anthropogenic impacts. Sea-level rise and other effects of global warming are expected to intensify other anthropogenic pressures, and could cause unprecedented ecological impacts. The definition of the relevant scales of analysis, which will vary according to the magnitude of the impact and the organisational level under analysis, and the recognition of a physical--biological coupling at different scales, should be included in approaches to quantify impacts. Zoning strategies and marine reserves, which have not been widely implemented in sandy beaches, could be a key tool for biodiversity conservation and should also facilitate spillover effects into adjacent beach habitats. Setback and zoning strategies need to be enforced through legislation, and all relevant stakeholders should be included in the design, implementation and institutionalisation of these initiatives. New perspectives for rational management of sandy beaches require paradigm shifts, by including not only basic ecosystem principles, but also incentives for effective governance and sharing of management roles between government and local stakeholders.},

	abstract = {The light-limitation hypothesis was tested to assess whether water turbidity had caused the decline of a Mediterranean Posidonia oceanica (L.) Delile meadow in an area affected by a harbor. The annual growth, photosynthesis and rhizome starch concentrations of seagrass were measured and related to changes in light availability and dissolved nutrient concentration along a gradient of meadow degradation from areas close to the harbor outwards. Environmental and plant variables were measured in three stations placed along this gradient and compared with a reference station at an undisturbed meadow. The light attenuation coefficient (k) increased toward the inner harbor area, mainly due to sediment resuspension. The shoot density and leaf productivity of P. oceanica shoots were much lower in disturbed stations of the inner harbor area than in the outer, less disturbed station and the reference meadow. However, daily leaf carbon gains, calculated from the photosynthetic rates at saturating irradiance (Pmax) and the daily period in which seagrass receives light higher than its saturating irradiance (Hsat), suggested positive C-balance in all stations. This was partly explained by photo-acclimatization of seagrass to the reduced light availability at the disturbed harbor stations (inner and intermediate), as indicated by the lengthening of Hsat and the decrease in saturating irradiance (Isat) and respiratory demands. Despite photo-acclimatization, disturbed harbor stations showed less positive C-balance, seen not only in their lower leaf growth and biomass but also in a decrease in rhizome carbohydrate reserves (starch). Our results suggest that light reduction account for the reduced seagrass productivity and abundance. However, meadow decline (in terms of shoot mortality) in the harbor area is well above that predicted from similar light environments of nearby meadows or simulated in shading experiments. Thus, there are other factors than light limitation involved in seagrass mortality, most probably through more complex interactions (e.g. nutrient-epiphytes-grazers, water quality----siltation).},

In an earlier paper we showed that statistical modeling of historical shoreline data was improved by including large storms in the model via a transient storm function. Here we show that, at shorter timescales of months to years, modeling of the shoreline at Assateague Island, MD is improved by a storm model with both transient and persistent components. We find that the shoreline recovers from the storm rapidly, almost within a year, but that the recovery is only partial, despite anthropogenic reconstruction of a pre-existing berm. The long-term trend of a shoreline (whether erosive, accretive, or stationary) can thus be regarded as the cumulative persistent component of successive storms, although most long-term data sets are too temporally sparse to make such a parameterization more useful than a steady long-term rate.},

THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE FOURTH ASSESSMENT REPORT (1) LARGELY overlooked the impacts of climate change on marine ecosystems (2). In their Review (``The impact of climate change on the world's marine ecosystems,'' 18 June, p. 1523), O. Hoegh-Guldberg and J. F. Bruno redress this gap by synthesizing recent literature. In so doing, they made the disparities in research among ocean systems apparent. Specifi  cally, there are no stud-ies of climate change impacts to sandy beach ecosystems. Rather than any over-sight by Hoegh-Guldberg and Bruno or previous authors (3), we believe that the omission of beaches from this and other assessments  of  anthropogenic  impacts  refl ects a relative lack of appreciation of beaches as ecosystems. This paucity of beach studies (4, 5) is  alarming,  not  only  because  beaches  comprise  {\textasciitilde}70\%  of  open-ocean  coasts  and have high socioeconomic and eco-system value, but also because their posi-tion at the land-sea margin renders them highly  vulnerable  to  climate  change  (5, 6). Beaches are at risk of signifi  cant habitat loss and ecological impacts from warming, acid-ifi cation, and erosion caused by sea-level rise and increased storms. Where landward retreat of beaches is restricted by development or topography, beach habitat may disappear. When engineering interventions seek to mitigate beach erosion, negative ecological consequences may be severe but are only beginning to be understood (6, 7). The inadequacy of information on ecological impacts of climate change on this vulnerable and challenged coastal ecosystem must be addressed.},

@article{schlacher_sandy_2007,
	abstract = {Sandy beaches line most of the world's oceans and are highly valued by society: more people use sandy beaches than any other type of shore. While the economic and social values of beaches are generally regarded as paramount, sandy shores also have special ecological features and contain a distinctive biodiversity that is generally not recognized. These unique ecosystems are facing escalating anthropogenic pressures, chiefly from rapacious coastal development, direct human uses --- mainly associated with recreation --- and rising sea levels. Beaches are increasingly becoming trapped in a `coastal squeeze' between burgeoning human populations from the land and the effects of global climate change from the sea. Society's interventions (e.g. shoreline armouring, beach nourishment) to combat changes in beach environments, such as erosion and shoreline retreat, can result in severe ecological impacts and loss of biodiversity at local scales, but are predicted also to have cumulative large‐scale consequences worldwide. Because of the scale of this problem, the continued existence of beaches as functional ecosystems is likely to depend on direct conservation efforts. Conservation, in turn, will have to increasingly draw on a consolidated body of ecological theory for these ecosystems. Although this body of theory has yet to be fully developed, we identify here a number of critical research directions that are required to progress coastal management and conservation of sandy beach ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Because studies of environmental accidents must be initiated after the  fact and because the accidents cannot (or should not) be replicated, sampling cannot be entirely randomized, and investigations involve some degree of confounding and pseudoreplication. The study designs that can be  used carry methodological limitations and  ecological as-sumptions, which must be considered in evaluating results. The methodological issues relate to consistency in sampling methods and to the adequacy of sampling of levels of environ-mental disturbance or contamination, while the ecological assumptions derive from spatial and  temporal variation in biological resources and  the  factors that affect them. We assess how these methodological issues and  ecological assumptions affect study designs based on before-after comparisons and on  single-time or multiple-time sampling after an  accident. Designs that rest  on the assumption of a  steady-state equilibrium in resource-environment relationships (baseline and time-series designs) must be interpreted with particular care, and baseline designs are sensitive to  the effects of pseudoreplication and  inconsistencies in  methods. Other designs (pre/post paired samples, impact level-by-time, impact trend-by-time) assume only that environmental variations are equivalent among areas and/or contamination levels (a dynamic equilibrium) and  are less affected by  pseu-doreplication. Single-time designs (comparisons between impact and reference sites, be-tween matched paired sites, or over a contamination gradient) have fewer methodological limitations, but assume that other natural factors that  may influence ·the response of a resource are equal among all samples. If measurements of other factors are included in the design, covariance analysis may help to reduce this problem. In evaluating the effects of unplanned environmental impacts, post facto study designs that document both initial effects and  subsequent recovery (impact level-by-time, impact trend-by-time) or that treat effects as continuous rather than categorical variables (gradient or trend designs) may be  more useful than before-after comparisons.},

The effects on an intertidal exoedicerotid amphipod, Exoediceros fossor (Stimpson, 1856), were examined using a beyond-BACI (Before--After, Control--Impact) sampling design. Sampling was conducted before and after engineering operations at sites within the borrow and nourishment locations and multiple control locations. Hypotheses concerning impact and recovery were tested using asymmetrical ANOVAs and two-tailed F-tests. These examined the effects on abundance and spatial variability, respectively. The impact of the engineering operations on abundance was very large at both borrow and nour- ishment locations. However, recovery started within several weeks and, using space · time interactions as a criterion, appeared to be complete within a year. This conclusion is made cautiously because of low statistical power and because other criteria for recovery suggest that it was not complete at some sites.

In order to predict effects on the intertidal sandy beach ecosystem, we developed a simulation model that integrates species envelope-based projections for the dominant macrobenthos species and mechanistic food web modules for higher trophic levels.2.Species envelopes were estimated by using Bayesian inference of species' biomass relationships according to the three determining abiotic variables: intertidal elevation, median grainsize and total organic matter, obtained from multiple sampling campaigns along the Belgian coast. Maximum potential abundance of higher trophic levels represented by birds, shrimpand flatfish were estimated based on their derived trophic relationship with macrobenthos.3.After validation, we demonstrated that unlike nourishment slope, sediment grain size strongly determines beach-level species richness and production, with strong deterioration in species richness after nourishment with coarse sediment ({\textgreater}300lm). Patterns for higher trophic levels do not follow the changes in macrobenthos abundance and biomass.4.Synthesis and applications. The optimal grain size range for nourishment of fine-grained beaches is 200--300lm. This modelling approach shows that the impact assessment of beach nourishment needs to include the evaluation of different species richness and biomass variables. Focusing solely on the potential abundance of species from higher trophic levels might lead to deceptive conclusions due to the dominance of opportunistic prey species},

However, the beach infauna may be affected by such a disturbance. Up to 3 m of sand have been piled upon beaches, followed by enhanced sediment dynamics. The impact of two nourishment operations of different magnitude (159,000 and 351,000 m3/2 km beach line) on meio- and macrofauna across a shore on the island of Sylt (North Sea) has been studied between 1999 and 2001. No significant effect on meiofauna was noticed after the smaller operation in 1999, while a decreased copepod abundance in the shallow subtidal and a reduced polychaete species density at mid shore occurred four months after the larger nourishment. In the macrofauna, a short-term reduction of the two species dominating the shallow subtidal, the isopod Eurydice pulchra and the polychaete Scolelepis squamata, was noticed in 1999. A stronger and more lasting negative effect was caused by the larger operation in 2000. Macrofaunal abundance and species density in the deeper subtidal zone were lower than at the reference site even nine months after the nourishment. However, these infaunal responses to both beach nourishments are not considered as dramatic when compared to natural changes along the shore and between years. From an ecological perspective, sand replenishments may be regarded as an acceptable method for coastal protection, provided that intervals of at least three years are kept between successive operations at a given site.},

We monitored the intertidal invertebrate community for fifteen months following a nourishment project at eight beaches across San Diego County. Each beach was split into nourished and control sections. Nearly all taxa showed major declines in abundance immediately following nourishment. Populations of talitrid amphipods and the bean clam Donax gouldii recovered within one year, sooner than in previous studies. Populations of the mole crab Emerita

analoga bloomed at four months after nourishment, and were more numerous on nourished portions of beaches at that time. Mole crab populations subsequently declined and no longer differed by treatment. The polychaete community, composed of Scolelepis spp. and several other numerically important taxa, showed a strong nourishment-induced reduction in abundance that persisted through the end of the study. The large negative effect of nourishment on polychaetes, coupled with their overall importance to the invertebrate community, resulted in a more than twofold reduction in overall invertebrate abundance on nourished beaches at 15 months. Such reductions may have far reaching consequences for sandy beach ecosystems, as community declines can reduce prey availability for shorebirds and fish. As this and other recent studies have revealed longer times for the recovery of intertidal invertebrates than previously observed, more cautious estimates regarding the magnitude and duration of impacts of beach nourishment should be applied to management practices.},

Sediments taken from maintenance dredging of a channel in Bogue Sound and used for beach nourishment in a replicated design were substantially finer (3.67 vs 2.33 {\O}) than those of untreated beaches and contained large concentrations of shell hash. In response to nourishment, densities of Emerita talpoida and Donax spp. were lower by 86-99\% on nourished beaches in early-mid July, 5-10 weeks after cessation of the nourishment project. Beach bulldozing done to augment the primary dune reduced the width of the intertidal beach by about 7 m and replaced it with a wedge of coarser, shellier sand taken from the lower beach. In late July-early August about 3 months after termination of bulldozing, counts of active burrows of ghost crabs Ocypode quadrata were 55-65\% lower on bulldozed beaches, with most of the reduction occurring on the 7 m of high beach occupied by the newly formed dune face. Despite no detectable difference in slope of the lower beach, Emerita talpoida densities were 35-37\% lower on bulldozed beach segments of 0.5- and 3-km, and, while Donax spp. exhibited no consistent residual response to bulldozing, two of three contrasts showed increased abundances of {\textgreater} 100\% on bulldozed segments. Failure of Emerita and Donax to recover from nourishment by mid summer when they serve as a primary prey base for important surf fishes, ghost crabs, and some shorebirds may be a consequence of the poor match in grain size and high shell content of source sediments and/or extension of the project too far into the warm season. Effects of bulldozing on ghost crabs may conceivably be mitigated by measures to stabilize the dune face after bulldozing, but the effects on Emerita and Donax are not easily interpreted so potential mitigation measures for mole crabs and bean clams are unclear.},

	abstract = {It is widely assumed that hard shore-parallel structures on the beach are damaging to recrea tional beaches. Virtually all state coastal management programs assume this to be true. While there is broad agreement that walls are detrimental to adjacent beaches and that walls are passively responsible for narrowing of the beaches in front of them, controversy still remains over the question of whether seawalls play an active role in beach degradation. Coastal man agement initiatives should not be delayed on account of the technical argument regarding sea wall behavior. From the standpoint of the general public, the important question is whether seawalls negatively impact beaches, rather than exactly how it happens. It is argued in this paper that there are a number of mechanisms by which seawalls can accelerate erosion of the beach in front of them and that, until research proves otherwise, active beach degradation remains a real possibility. In this investigation, we have also compared the dry beach width on selected stabilized and unstabilized East Coast shorelines and note that dry beach width is consistently and signifi cantly narrower in front of walls. The more dense the hard stabilization, the narrower the beach. Future research on seawall effects must take into account the fact that beach destruction may take place over several decades and study of single events or short-term changes may be of limited value in understanding effects of seawalls.},

	abstract = {Much sampling to detect and quantify human environmental disturbances is flawed by a lack of appropriate replication. BACI (Before-After-Control-Impact) designs have only a single control location, and any conclusions from them are illogical. Asymmetrical designs using one putatively impacted and several control locations can reliably detect a variety of environmental impacts, including those that do not affect long-run mean abundances, but do alter temporal variance. When abundances of populations in different locations show temporal interaction, the asymmetrical designs allow tests for impact that are not possible in BACI designs. Asymmetrical designs are also extendable to sample at hierarchical spatial and temporal scales. The power of tests using asymmetrical designs is great for non-interactive sets of abundances, but greatest for pulse (short-term) responses to disturbances, large alterations of temporal variance, or combinations of temporal variance, or combinations of sustained, press responses in mean abundance coupled with altered temporal heterogeneity. Power in temporally interactive sets of data is generally poor. Alternatives to pre-disturbance sampling, including generalized assessment of spatial and temporal variances and experimental impacts, may provide better guidance for detection of human disturbances.},

	abstract = {The effects of beach renourishment on a major marine turtle nesting beach (Jupiter Island) in Florida were studied over seven years. This made possible a long-term comparison between reproductive activity on several beaches, ren- ourished at different times, and a control beach composed of natural sand. Our goal was to determine if renourishment resulted in a nesting beach that, from the turtles' perspective, was equivalent to a natural beach. Equivalence was based upon two criteria: the number of nests placed by females on an equal length of beach (nest "density"), and by the proportion of eggs that developed into hatchlings that left those nests. Nests deposited on the renourished and natural beaches did not differ statistically in the proportion of eggs that developed into departing hatchlings. But females placed significantly fewer nests on the renourished beaches than on the control beach. There were several correlates. When renourished beaches were narrowed by erosion, fewer turtles nested there. After renourishment, more turtles tried to nest but a large proportion of them abandoned these attempts. Abandoned nesting attempts were positively correlated with the greater surface hardness of the renourished beach. Berms tended to form after each renourishment project and these probably prevented some females from crawling to preferred nesting sites. After two years, surface hardness decreased, berms were rarely present, nesting attempts were more often successful, and nesting densities on the renourished beach were comparable to those on the control beach. But in subsequent years, nesting densities declined again as erosion narrowed the renourished beach. Thus at Jupiter Island, less nesting occurred on renourished beaches because these sites cycled between relatively long and unattractive, and relatively short and attractive, "states". To the extent that other renourished beaches mimic these cycles, they also represent inferior nesting habitats. It is therefore imperative to reduce beach-front armoring and associated development (which accelerates erosion), and to protect the few remaining natural nesting beaches used by sea turtles in Florida.},

	abstract = {Since 2011, beach nourishment has become the preferred solution for mitigating coastal
erosion along the Mediterranean coast of Israel, as it is considered ``soft'' and environmentally friendly. However, using fine sand for nourishment in Israel without supporting measures is problematic due to the high wave energy and strong longshore currents in the littoral zone that tend to drift the sand away. This would require ongoing, multiyear, costly, and never-ending maintenance. In the present study, we analyzed sand and pebble alternatives for nourishment of the eroded beach in front of Tel Ashkelon, an important coastal archaeological site in southern Israel that suffers from severe erosion. Based on Pranzini et al. (2018), we analyzed the alternatives, evaluated their cost and efficiency, and assessed their potential environmental impacts. The study concluded that for protecting the southern part of Tel Ashkelon beach, pebble nourishment is the optimal solution, mainly regarding durability and cost. Using this material for nourishment will better absorb the storm wave impact and protect the foot of the archaeological Tel from erosion, and require lower maintenance cost than using finer sand nourishment.},

@inproceedings{peterson_how_2001,
	abstract = {Our research on ecological impacts of beach nourishment in North Carolina has involved monitoring of projects in the field, conducting process-oriented experiments on the beach and in unique wave tank mesocosms, and reviewing the statistical adequacy of sampling designs of beach nourishment monitoring studies. This work has led to tentative answers to long-standing questions and insight into why uncertainty over the ecological impacts still persists. Monitoring of two projects in North Carolina, one on Bogue Banks and a second on Topsail Island, provides evidence that implies strongly that sediment grade used for beach fill influences the extent of impact and recovery for the intertidal beach macrofauna and thus their ecosystem service of feeding surf fishes and resident and migratory shorebirds. The fill materials used in both projects resulted in a substantial fining of beach sediments and increased sorting: one project also enhanced shell fragments. Nourishment on Bogue Banks using sediments taken from ICW maintenance dredging resulted in increasing the median phi index from 2.3 to 3.7 and produced an 86-99\% reduction in abundance of the two dominant macrofaunal organisms, Donax spp. and Emerita talpoida. The project was completed in April at one site and 24 May at the other, yet the 86-99\% reductions in abundance of macrofauna were evident in mid July. This implies that the habitat value of the intertidal beach was lost to vertebrate consumers for at least the spring and summer, if not longer. Nourishment (disposal) on Topsail Island using sediments dredged from an inlet channel resulted in fill placement on the beaches from April into May or early June in each of two successive years. This project resulted in fining of sediments (changing median phi from 1.25 to 2.25), an increase in sorting (changing phi from 0.9 to 0.4), and enhanced turbidity in the surf zone during active sediment pumping. The sedimentological differences persisted long enough that there was no detectable recovery between projects spaced a year apart. Impacts on the benthic macrofauna were dramatic and long-lasting. The biomass dominant, Donax spp., exhibited a {\textgreater}50\% reduction in abundance integrated over the whole summer of peak production. A similar pattern was expressed by two of the most abundant amphipods, Parahaustorius longimerus and Amphiporeia virginiana. The mole crab Emerita talpoida virtually disappeared from the nourished beach for the full year after one of the two nourishment events. Only one common species, the polychaete Scolelepus squamata, exhibited enhanced abundance on the nourished beach. The body sizes of both Donax variabilis and Emerita talpoida were substantially smaller on the nourished beaches and never exhibited convergence with sizes on the control beaches during the two years of study. Consequently, this project resulted in reduction of habitat value of the intertidal beach for most surf fishes and shorebirds through reduced prey abundance and body size, a compound impact on production and trophic transfer.},

Planning nourishment in the context of a multi-years management strategy requires more significant prediction skills than available in the past and an awareness of dealing with uncertainty. The present paper introduces model classes and modelling situations and describes those elements that are the main sources of such uncertainty. Equilibrium Profile (EP) and Depth of Closure (DoC) are discussed with their time-scale related aspects; granulometry changes are discussed with their effects on the dynamics of a nourished coast; estimation of erosion rate is introduced with its implications on the definition of the ``basic state'' or the ``basic trend'' of the coastal system; lateral spreading and beach fill transition are discussed with their economic implications; and calibration and verification are introduced with the additional degrees of freedom that might be added to model development and with reference to risk issues in decision-making. These sources of uncertainty are examined in relation with implications for nourishment and modelling. The main conclusion is that, while there have been significant advances in modelling morphodynamics and morphodynamics applied to nourishment design, advances in defining procedures for quality control of the modelling activity are now required.},

While preferable to hard erosion control structures such as seawalls and groins, fiscal and economic issues have cast doubt on the efficacy of beach nourishment as an affordable, equitable and sustainable erosion response measure. Of particular concern are the delineation of costs and benefits, how costs and benefits are distributed and the possibility that storm damage reduction benefits -- the economic force that drives nearly all beach nourishment projects -- may never materialize. An accurate accounting of potential future costs must be combined with a pragmatic expectation of potential benefits before beach nourishment can be compared, let alone considered preferable, to non-traditional coastal erosion response measures such as retreat.},

These issues are most often investigated in a cross‐shore profile framework, fostering the implicit assumption that coastline responses will be approximately uniform in the alongshore direction. However, experiments with a recently developed numerical model of coastline change on a large spatial domain suggest that the shoreline responses to climate change could be highly variable. As storm and wave climates change, large‐scale coastline shapes are likely to shift---causing areas of greatly accelerated coastal erosion to alternate with areas of considerable shoreline accretion. On complex‐shaped coastlines, including cuspate‐cape and spit coastlines, the alongshore variation in shoreline retreat rates could be an order of magnitude higher than the baseline retreat rate expected from sea‐level rise alone.},

In this paper, we couple a human component to a numerical model of large‐scale coastline evolution, incorporating beach ``nourishment'' (periodically placing sand on the beach, also called ``beach replenishment'' or ``beach fill''). Beach nourishment is the most prevalent means humans employ to alter the natural shoreline system in our case study, the Carolina coastline. Beach nourishment can cause shorelines adjacent to those that are nourished to shift both seaward and landward. When we further consider how changes to storm behaviors could change wave climates, the magnitude of morphological change induced by beach nourishment can rival that expected from sea level rise and affect the coast as far as tens of kilometers away from the nourishment site. In some instances, nonlocal processes governing large‐scale cuspate‐cape coastline evolution may transmit the human morphological ``signal'' over surprisingly large (hundreds of kilometer) distances.},

	abstract = {The combination of rising sea level, more frequent and intensive storms, and increasing rates of coastal development have led to increased demands for the restoration of eroding sandy shorelines, and consequently, beach nourishment projects. Understanding and communicating the potential environmental impacts of these projects to the lay-public and broader scientific community, therefore, is an important responsibility of researchers. Several recent reviews of biological monitoring studies of beach nourishment projects have questioned both the validity of past monitoring efforts and the interpretation of results that indicate minor impacts. We reexamine the same monitoring literature (along with more recently published studies) and summarize the results. In addition, the following recommendations are made based on monitoring results (1) When logistically and economically feasible, avoid active beach nourishment activities during seasons of peak larval recruitment to the benthos (e.g., the spring for the eastern US). (2) To the extent practical, use compatible sediments (e.g., matching grain size distributions between fill and native beach sediments) to minimize recovery times and retain similar benthic macrofaunal community composition. (3) Avoid creating deep pits with steep side-slopes at borrow areas such that depositional and water quality conditions are substantially altered. (4) Locate borrow sites in areas that are likely to refill rapidly with beach compatible sediments (e.g., in relation to net direction of sediment bedload transport and littoral drift, or areas with high sand accretion rates). (5) Focus monitoring effort on potential mechanisms of impact rather than changes to mean abundances for target biota that are highly variable in space and time. (6) Identify monitoring objectives and select methodologies that contribute to a better understanding of biological responses to nourishment-related disturbance, including a determination of meaningful effect sizes. (7) Use BACI (Before-After Control-Impact) monitoring designs such that the magnitude and duration of effects that are biologically meaningful can be detected.},

@article{brock_effects_2009,
	abstract = {Marine turtle reproductive success is correlated with the stability and quality of the nesting environment. Female marine turtles show fidelity to nesting beaches, making artificial beach nourishment practices directly relevant to their recovery. We evaluated the impacts of artificial beach nourishment on Loggerhead (Caretta caretta ) and Green turtles (Chelonia mydas ) between artificially nourished and nonnourished beaches. We observed reduced nesting success (ratio of nesting emergences to emergences not resulting in nest deposition) for both species. This negative effect lasted for one season in Loggerheads and for at least one season in Green turtles. Physical attributes of the fill sand did not impede nesting attempts. We argue that the decrease in nesting success resulted from an altered beach profile not favorable for nest deposition, which subsequently improved in later seasons as the beach equilibrated to a more natural slope. We observed a 52.2\% decrease in reproductive output (hatchlings km−1 yr−1) for Loggerheads one year postnourishment, with a 44.1\% increase observed the two seasons postnourishment. In Green turtles, a 0.8\% reduction was observed the first season postnourishment, despite a 13\% increase in the nonnourished area. The reduction in reproductive output in both cases was primarily a consequence of decreased nesting success, lowering nest numbers. These results reveal stronger negative effects of beach nourishment on Loggerheads compared to Green turtles and the importance of minimizing excessive nonnesting emergences associated with artificial beach nourishment. Nourished areas also experienced more than 600\% increase in the number of Loggerhead hatchlings disoriented by artificial lighting over two years postnourishment.},
	annote = {Introduction
For oviparous species, the habitat in which eggs are deposited strongly influences offspring survival and may have important consequences for adult reproductive success (Martin 1988; Hays \& Speakman 1993). Marine turtles have an oviparous reproductive strategy and thus depend on suitable terrestrial nesting environments (Miller 1997; Pritchard 1997). Gravid marine turtles typically exhibit nest site fidelity to beaches with characteristics conducive to successful nesting over evolutionary time (Carr 1986; Witherington 1986; Bowen et al. 1992; Bowen 1995; Weishampel et al. 2003). Coastal ecosystem management at nesting beaches directly affects future generations of marine turtles and is essential for the recovery of these endangered species.
Coastal ecosystems are dynamic and experience erosional and accrectional fluctuations from sedimentary exchange between dune, beach, and offshore sand sources. Global climate change and sea level rise lead to enhanced coastal erosion (Walton 1978; Nicholls \& Klein 2004), and vulnerability of a particular beach varies with adjacent land use (Fish et al. 2005). Anthropogenic components can obstruct or accelerate coastal processes (Southwick 1996). Artificial navigational inlets prevent the littoral transport of sands and result in chronic erosion on downdrift beaches (Douglas 2002; Kriebel et al. 2003). Conversely, shoreline recession is impeded by urban coastal development and armoring (i.e., seawalls, bulkheads, or rock revetments; Olsen \& Bodge 1991; Pilkey 1991) in that a fixed landward boundary is established that prevents or disrupts sedimentary exchanges. These pressures, collectively termed coastal squeeze (Doody 2001), lead to the reduction of dry beaches and, consequently, nesting habitat for marine turtles.
Loggerheads (Caretta caretta) and Green turtles (Chelonia mydas) typically favor steeply sloped, moderate‐ to high‐energy beaches, with gradually sloped offshore approaches where a deep nest cavity can be dug above the high water line (Provancha \& Ehrhart 1987; Hays et al. 1995). This often results in Green turtles nesting further from the water because their larger size allows for a deeper nest cavity relative to Loggerheads. Nesting habitats frequently overlap between the two species. In the United States, Loggerhead nests greatly outnumber Green turtle nests, but Green turtles still nest in significant numbers. Green turtle nest production in the United States has exhibited a high/low biennial pattern since at least 1989. Even‐numbered years (e.g., 2000, 2002) have experienced a high number of nests, whereas nest production decreases during odd‐numbered years (e.g., 1999, 2001). From 1989 to 2003, the estimated annual number of Loggerhead nests in the United States has fluctuated without a conspicuous trend (Weishampel et al. 2004).
The Atlantic beaches of east central Florida, U.S.A., along the Archie Carr National Wildlife Refuge (included in this study), have provided nest sites for 18\% of the Atlantic basin Loggerhead population and for at least 30\% of the Florida Atlantic Green turtle population (NMFS \& USFWS 1991; Ehrhart et al. 2003). These beaches are critically eroded and subject to instability, accelerated rates of erosion (Bruun 1962), loss of habitat to coastal development, and chronic erosion caused by an updrift navigational inlet known as Port Canaveral Inlet (Kriebel et al. 2003). These conditions have led to the development of a long‐term management plan calling for the ``restoration and maintenance'' of these beaches. Due to the economic value of developed coastal property (Douglas 2002), the attrition over many decades required for inland retreat, and the detrimental effects of coastal armoring, artificial beach nourishment is currently the accepted engineering solution for shoreline protection (Lucas \& Parkinson 2002). This is particularly relevant in the light of global climate change and rising sea levels (Fish et al. 2005).
Artificial beach nourishment, commonly referred to as beach nourishment or restoration, is the mechanical placement of sand on a beach to advance the shoreline seaward or to build up a dune (Dean 2002). This process results in an engineered beach that may or may not restore natural processes. Artificial beach nourishment projects modify ecosystem components (sand grain size, shape and color, silt--clay and moisture content, beach hardness, mineral content, water potential, and porosity/gas diffusion) and potentially cause detrimental changes to the biota in the area (Dean 2002). Nourishment projects also modify marine turtle nesting beaches, potentially influencing nesting and reproductive success. However, properly implemented nourishment projects can mitigate the loss of marine turtle nesting beaches when the alternative is chronically eroded or nonexistent beaches (i.e., low‐quality nesting habitat).
The effect on total reproductive output for marine turtles is a crucial component for determining the success of nourishment projects. These projects affect nesting marine turtles in several ways (Crain et al. 1995), and thus, impact assessment must integrate responses in terms of both nesting behavior and reproductive success.
Previous studies and generalizations concerning nourishment projects have focused on the negative impacts on Loggerhead turtles (Crain et al. 1995; Trindell et al. 1998). Previously documented effects on Green turtles have not been reported using statistically significant sample sizes (n {\textless} 20; Ehrhart \& Herren 1998; Ehrhart \& Holloway‐Adkins 2000; Palm Beach County Department of Environmental Resources Management 2001). We describe the effects of a nourishment project on populations of two species of marine turtles: the Loggerhead and the Green turtle. Using pre‐ and post-nourishment comparisons to adjacent non-nourished (natural) beaches, we were able to distinguish direct effects of the nourishment project from naturally fluctuating patterns in both species.
Our objectives included a comparative evaluation for Loggerhead and Green turtles of standard parameters such as assessing total nesting, nesting success, nest placement, and overall reproductive success and accounting for effects on post-emergence hatchlings. By incorporating these parameters, we test the hypothesis that a single beach nourishment project will have no effect on Loggerhead or Green turtles.},

	abstract = {Coastal areas play a crucial role in the economical, social and political development of most countries; they support diverse and productive coastal ecosystems that provide valuable goods and services. Globally flooding and coastal erosion represent serious threats along many coastlines, and will become more serious as a consequence of human-induced changes and accelerated sea-level rise. Over the past century, hard coastal defence structures have become ubiquitous features of coastal landscapes as a response to these threats. The proliferation of defence works can affect over half of the shoreline in some regions and results in dramatic changes to the coastal environment. Surprisingly little attention has been paid to the ecological consequences of coastal defence. Results from the DELOS (Environmental Design of Low Crested Coastal Defence Structures, EVK3-CT-2000-00041) project indicate that the construction of coastal defence structures will affect coastal ecosystems. The consequences can be seen on a local scale, as disruption of surrounding soft-bottom environments and introduction of new artificial hard-bottom habitats, with consequent changes to the native assemblages of the areas. Proliferation of coastal defence structures can also have critical impacts on regional species diversity, removing isolating barriers, favouring the spread of non-native species and increasing habitat heterogeneity. Knowledge of the environmental context in which coastal defence structures are placed is fundamental to an effective management of these structures as, while there are some general consequences of such construction, many effects are site specific. Advice is provided to meet specific management goals, which include mitigating specific impacts on the environment, such as minimising changes to surrounding sediments, spread of exotic species or growth of nuisance species, and/or enhancing specific natural resources, for example enhancing fish recruitment or promoting diverse assemblages for eco-tourism. The DELOS project points out that the downstream effects of defence structures on coastal processes and regional-scale impacts on biodiversity necessitate planning and management at a regional (large coastline) scale. To effectively understand and manage coastal defences, environmental management goals must be clearly stated and incorporated into the planning, construction, and monitoring stages.},

We tested whether sediment descriptors (grain size structure and organic content) and macrobenthic assemblages (species composition and abundance) differed among replicated shores previously exposed to nourishment alone (N), nourishment in combination with pre-existing hard structures (N + H) or no nourishment (NoN) along about 50 km of shores of the Emilia Romagna region (North Adriatic Sea, Italy). There was large variation among shores. Two out of three N shores were nearly defaunated, while one N shore had species composition and abundances comparable to NoN shores. There were also large differences between N and N + H shores, the latter possessing higher abundances of organisms and the presence of species that do not usually occur in the nearshore surf habitats in this region. More than 50\% of the variability in the benthic assemblages was related to variations in the grain size structure of the sediments among shores. The results suggest that beach nourishments may lead to modifications of sedimentary environments and inhabiting fauna, but the resulting effects may be strongly related to local conditions, which dictate the rate at which added sand is redistributed.},

@article{grain_effects_1995,
	abstract = {Beach nourishment is an engineering solution to erosion of beaches. As in any restoration project, the goals of beach nourishment are the restoration of habitat to promote survival of plants and animals and to maintain aesthetically pleasing sites for humans. Unfortunately, beach nourishment sometimes alters parameters of the natural beach, decreasing the reproductive success of sea turtles. Engineers have recognized this problem and are working to improve nourishment practices. Biologists must specify problems incurred by sea turtles as a result of beach nourishment so that they may be addressed. A review of the literature on sea turtles and beach nourishment found certain problems repeatedly identified. For nesting females, characteristics induced by nourishment can cause (1) beach compaction, which can decrease nesting success, alter nest‐chamber geometry, and alter nest concealment, and (2) escarpments, which can block turtles from reaching nesting areas. For eggs and hatchlings, nourishment can decrease survivorship and affect development by altering beach characteristics such as sand compaction, gaseous environment, hydric environment, contaminant levels, nutrient availability, and thermal environment. Also, nests can be covered with excess sand if nourishment is implemented in areas with incubating eggs. The extent and implication of each problem are discussed, and future research initiatives are proposed.},

@mastersthesis{rimkus_hydric_1992,
	abstract = {Sea turtles use beaches as incubators for their eggs. The female sea turtles come ashore to lay their eggs in the beach, where they are left to incubate. A female sea turtle may excavate many nest cavities before depositing her eggs in the final nest. In some way the female sea turtle is choosing one location for her nest over all of the others. How a female sea turtle determines the suitability of a nest is unknown. It is certain that if the eggs are to hatch they need to be placed in a region of the beach that will not flood, become too dry, have impeded gas exchange, or have any other event occur that will not allow the eggs to undergo proper development over the next 50 to 60 days. Sea turtles are not the only beach users. Humans utilize beaches for many activities, most of which are recreational. There is very little impact on sea turtle nests from the people who use the beach for recreational purposes; for even where driving on the beach is allowed, the nests are in the soft sand that is further landward than most cars drive. A problem arises when a developed beach front with a natural nesting beach in front of it erodes to the point where the sea turtles are no longer able to use the beach as an incubator for their eggs. Beach erosion is part of a natural process (Carter, 1988). In some areas sand is being added to the shore, or accreted, while at the same time sand is eroding from another 
2 site. This process has happened for thousands of years, and thus far, sea turtles have survived despite these changing conditions. Humans, on the other hand are concerned about beach erosion because it decreases property value as well as threatening structural damage to the development. Therefore, humans have proposed many solutions to the problem of beach erosion. Many of these solutions attempting to curb or prevent erosion also hamper the ability of turtles to use the beaches that are being protected. One method that has been used more recently, known as beach renourishment, may not affect the ability of a female turtle to use the beach. The process of beach renourishment is carried out by pumping materials back onto an eroded beach (Carter, 1988). The sand is pumped up in a slurry of salt water from an offshore dredge site or from a sand trap in an inlet. This process in not likely to change erosion patterns, and after renourishment the erosion process may continue, requiring further renourishment. Beach renourishment is a temporary solution to the problem of erosion. However, renourished beaches are not deposited in the same manner as natural beaches. The impacts of beach renourishment on the sea turtle nesting environment have not been fully analyzed. The purpose of this thesis is to characterize the renourished beach environment both with respect to the physical and the hydric properties and to compare this 
3 environment to a control. A logical choice for a control would be a beach that is known to be an effective incubator of sea turtle eggs. Natural beaches are known to be effective incubators of sea turtle eggs, therefore they will serve as the control beaches. However, the environment of the natural beaches has never been completely characterized. Therefore, the natural and renourished beaches should both be assessed at the same time in order to assure a proper comparison.},

A detailed time series of beach monitoring has provided a wealth of data on turtle nesting and resistance to penetration in order to assess the effect of beach nourishment on turtle nesting. Three adjacent, nourished beaches, and nearby unnourished beaches provided the locations for systematic measurement of conditions. Two years of data are provided, 1994 and 1995, with the latter including tilling of the nourished beach on one of the projects. Nesting density increased from 1994 to 1995. Although cone penetrometer measurements routinely exceeded guide- lines for turtle nesting, the turtles paid no attention to compaction. The nature of the sediment with large quantities of bivalve fragments is such that although vertical penetration is very difficult, the style of digging by turtles expe- riences little resistance. Data provided in this study indicate that the current guidelines based on cone penetrometer data for nesting in highly compacted beaches are incorrect. Nourished beaches on the Gulf Coast of Florida do not inhibit turtle nesting, they encourage it by providing a wide, dry beach.},

	abstract = {Beach nourishment and groynes building were implemented to counteract erosion in sandy beaches located at San Rossore natural park (Tuscany, Italy), near the mouth of Arno river. From 2000 to 2003, nine groynes were built along 3.6 km of coastline at intervals of ca. 400 m, and two of the eight beach segments were filled with marble gravel. Here, we analysed the effects of these beach changes on the abundance and behaviour of the amphipod Talitrus saltator, using field and laboratory observations. Sampling with pitfall traps in order to use the capture frequency as a proxy of abundance was performed bimonthly from September 2004 to January 2006, and orientation experiments were carried out in autumn (2004 and 2005), and spring and summer 2005. Physical variables (beach width, swash width, beach slope, sand penetrability, mean grain size and salinity) were also recorded. The abundance of T. saltator increased with the distance from the river mouth, towards sites with: negligible amounts of marble locally used for nourishment; higher beach width and salinity; lower slope and penetrability values; medium grain sizes, and during the spring/summer seasons. A Generalized Linear Model with a predictive power of 64.5\% considered three main descriptors in the model as significant: distance from the river mouth, sand penetrability and a seasonal factor. Orientation experiments showed a highly variable behaviour among sites, depending on coastal stability: at the site stabilized by the concurrent actions of nourishment and groynes protection measures, sandhoppers were oriented to the shoreline direction by using a sun compass; alternatively, at a site situated only 2 km from the nourished sites, they showed scattered orientation. These between-site differences in orientation, described through Spherically Projected Linear Models, were consistent throughout the study period. Different responses obtained at the individual (orientation) and population (captures) levels stress the need to account for several bioindicators to characterize biotic responses to both natural and anthropogenic changes in sandy beaches.},

Winter Harbor Beach and Smith Point Beach, located approximately 100 km to the north, historically have supported large populations of C. d. dorsalis. Grain size distributions, sediment compaction at two depths, temperature, mois- ture, and beach width habitat parameters were analyzed by analysis of variance and Tukey's honestly significant difference multiple comparison test and related to the distribution and abundance of C. d. dorsalis. The results from this study indicate that this species prefers beaches at least 6 m wide, with moderately well-sorted sands having a mean grain size of 0.5 to 0.6 mm, and relatively compacted sediment with averages of 69 psi and 110 psi at depths of 10 and 15 cm, respectively. In addition, the two nourishment projects had a positive short-term effect on the beetle habitat despite differences in deposition location. At Smith Point Beach, deposition occurred on top of the subaerial beach with a minimal increase in beach width. At Winter Harbor Beach, nearshore deposition caused a 50-m increase on average in beach width. Within weeks of deposition, adults of C. d. dorsalis rapidly moved onto the nourished sections of both beaches and produced large numbers of larvae. Winter Harbor Beach experienced the greatest increase in beetle numbers, most likely because of the additional habitat created by nearshore deposition. However, continued erosion from natural and anthropogenic sources could produce a chronic threat to productive habitats. These findings will assist coastal engineers and developers in determining effective measures designed to aid both economic and ecologic interests.},

@article{underwood_beyond_1992,
	abstract = {BACI (Before/After and Control/Impact) sampling is widely used in investigations of environ- mental impacts on mean abundance of a population. The principle is that an anthropogenic disturbance in the "impact" location will cause a different pattern of change from before to after it starts compared with natural change in the control location. This can be detectable efficiently as a statistical interaction in an analysis of variance of the data. Usually, samples are taken at replicated, random intervals of time before and after the putative impact starts; this ensures that chance temporal fluctuations in either location do not confound the detection of an impact. These designs are, however, insufficient because any location-specific temporal difference that occurs between the two locations will be interpreted as an impact even if it has nothing to do with the human disturbance. Alternatively, abundance in the single control location may change in the same direction, cancelling the effects of an impact. Here, asymmetrical designs are developed that compare the temporal change in a potentially impacted location with those in a randomly-selected set of control locations. An impact must cause a different temporal change in the disturbed location from what would be expected in similar locations. This can be detected for short-term (pulse) or long-term (press) impacts by different patterns of significance in the temporal interactions between time{\textasciitilde} of sampling and locations. From these novel designs, tests are derived that demonstrate whether an unusual pattern of temporal change in abundance of organisms is specific to the supposedly impacted location and correlated with the onset of the disturbance. Examples are presented of how to use these designs to detect impacts at different spatial scales. Other aspects of their use are discussed.},

Shoreline changes from 2020-2100 are projected along this entire coast using equilibrium profile theory that accurately predicted shoreline changes on Florida's east coast from 1970-2017 (Houston 2019). Projections for 2020- 2100 are made assuming past rates of beach nourishment for the 30-yr period from 1988-2017 will continue and sea level will rise according to recent projections of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that include the latest knowledge on ice melting in Antarctica (IPCC 2019). Using the beach nourishment and sea level rise data, equilibrium profile theory is then used to predict shoreline change from 2020-2100 for each IPCC sea level rise projection. Beach nourishment is shown to produce shoreline advance seaward on average for all IPCC scenarios for both the entire Florida coast and east coast and for all scenarios except the upper confidence level of the worst scenario for the southwest and Panhandle coasts. Some of the 30 counties on these coasts will require a greater rate of nourishment than in the past to offset sea level rise for some or all of the scenarios, whereas some will offset sea level rise for all scenarios with lower nourishment rates than in the past. The annual beach nourishment volume for which a county has a shortfall or surplus in offsetting sea level rise for each IPCC scenario can be calculated with the information provided and examples are presented. The approach can be used on coasts outside Florida if beach nourishment and sea level rise are expected to dominate future shoreline change.},

	abstract = {Sea‐level rise along low‐lying coasts of the world's passive continental margins should, on average, drive net shoreline retreat over large spatial scales ({\textgreater}102 km). A variety of natural physical factors can influence trends of shoreline erosion and accretion, but trends in recent rates of shoreline change along the U.S. Atlantic Coast reflect an especially puzzling increase in accretion, not erosion. A plausible explanation for the apparent disconnect between environmental forcing and shoreline response along the U.S. Atlantic Coast is the application, since the 1960s, of beach nourishment as the predominant form of mitigation against chronic coastal erosion. Using U.S. Geological Survey shoreline records from 1830--2007 spanning more than 2,500 km of the U.S. Atlantic Coast, we calculate a mean rate of shoreline change, prior to 1960, of −55 cm/year (a negative rate denotes erosion). After 1960, the mean rate reverses to approximately +5 cm/year, indicating widespread apparent accretion despite steady (and, in some places, accelerated) sea‐level rise over the same period. Cumulative sediment input from decades of beach‐nourishment projects may have sufficiently altered shoreline position to mask ``true'' rates of shoreline change. Our analysis suggests that long‐term rates of shoreline change typically used to assess coastal hazard may be systematically underestimated. We also suggest that the overall effect of beach nourishment along of the U.S. Atlantic Coast is extensive enough to constitute a quantitative signature of coastal geoengineering and may serve as a bellwether for nourishment‐dominated shorelines elsewhere in the world.},

	abstract = {Sea turtle egg mortality, egg predation, and small organisms associated with turtle nests were studied at Playa Ostional, Costa Rica. Sites with concentrated sea turtle nesting were compared with solitary nesting sites as a function of place and time based on ANOVA, Akaike's Information Criterion, and Bayesian analyses. Results indicate that sea turtle egg mortality was significantly associated (P \&lt; 0.005) with flowing water that erodes or saturates nesting sites, and with overlapped nesting in which sea turtles disturb each other's nests. Sarcophagid and calliphorid fly larvae (Bayesian prior = 1.19; posterior = 2.27), fungi (prior = 1.14; posterior = 1.92), mites (prior = 0.51; posterior = 1.15), and several other types of small organisms increased in number after turtle egg laying (N = 303 nests; 34,451 turtle eggs). During peak sea turtle nesting periods, visitation to nesting sites by poachers and vertebrate predators was high, and relative number of nests disturbed by these predators was low (P \&lt; 0.02). In multimodel analysis, the three most parsimonious models were: (1) turtle egg mortality and distance from mean high tide; (2) turtle egg predation and distance from mean high tide; and (3) turtle egg mortality and nesting density, with Akaike weights of 0.224, 0.203, and 0.153 respectively. Intensive sea turtle nesting might result in upwelling and turnover of nesting debris and nest organisms, and may influence biotic community structure of sandy beach ecosystems.},

@article{hanley_shifting_2014,
	abstract = {In a closely integrated system, (sub-) littoral sandy sediments, sandy beaches, and sand dunes offer natural coastal protection for a host of environmentally and economically important areas and activities inland. Flooding and coastal erosion pose a serious threat to these environments, a situation likely to be exacerbated by factors associated with climate change. Despite their importance, these sandy `soft' defences have been lost from many European coasts through the proliferation of coastal development and associated hard-engineering and face further losses due to sea-level rise, subsidence, storm surge events, and coastal squeeze. As part of the EU-funded THESEUS project we investigated the critical drivers that determine the persistence and maintenance of sandy coastal habitats around Europe's coastline, taking particular interest in their close link with the biological communities that inhabit them. The successful management of sandy beaches to restore and sustain sand budgets (e.g. via nourishment), depends on the kind of mitigation undertaken, local beach characteristics, and on the source of `borrowed' sediment. We found that inter-tidal invertebrates were good indicators of changes linked to different mitigation options. For sand dunes, field observations and manipulative experiments investigated different approaches to create new dune systems, in addition to measures employed to improve dune stabilisation. THESEUS provides a `toolbox' of management strategies to aid the management, restoration, and creation of sandy habitats along our coastlines, but we note that future management must consider the connectivity of sub-littoral and supra-littoral sandy habitats in order to use this natural shoreline defence more effectively.},

@article{van_egmond_mega-nourishment_2018,
	abstract = {Globally, sandy beaches are subject to coastal squeeze due to erosion. Soft-sediment strategies, such as sand nourishment, are increasingly applied to mitigate effects of erosion, but have long-term negative impacts on beach flora and fauna. As a more ecologically and sustainable alternative to regular beach nourishments, a mega-nourishment has been constructed along the Dutch coast by depositing 21.5 Mm3 of sand, from which sand is gradually redistributed along the coast by natural physical processes. The `Sand Motor' mega-nourishment was constructed as a long-term management alternative for coastal protection and is the first large-scale experiment of its kind. We evaluated the development of intertidal macroinvertebrate communities in relation to this mega-nourishment, and compared it to species composition of beaches subject to regular beach or no nourishment. We found that a mega-nourishment resulted initially in a higher macroinvertebrate richness, but a lower macroinvertebrate abundance, compared to regular beach nourishment. As there was no effect of year after nourishment, this finding suggests that colonization and/or local extinction were not limiting macroinvertebrate richness at the mega-nourishment. In addition, a mega-nourishment does not converge to an intertidal macroinvertebrate community similar to those on unnourished beaches within a time scale of four years. Beach areas at the mega-nourishment sheltered from waves harbored a distinct macroinvertebrate community compared to typical wave-exposed sandy beach communities. Thus, a mega-nourishment temporally creates new habitat for intertidal macroinvertebrates by enhancing habitat relief of the sandy beach. We conclude that a mega-nourishment may be a promising coastal defense strategy for sandy shores in terms of the macroinvertebrate community of the intertidal beach.},

However, these were generally too limited in scope to accurately evaluate beach nourishment because each omit one or more of the following: (1) a realistic assessment of potential borrow area sand volume, (2) native beach compatibility, (3) construction costs, (4) all vulnerable geomorphic elements of the coastal zone, and (5) environmental impacts. When all of these parameters are considered, the results are markedly different. To demonstrate our point, we evaluated the recommendations of Houston (2017) using all five parameters. Contrary to Houston, we provide multiple lines of evidence that beach fill projects are not a sustainable strategy to protect or defend oceanic beaches of the Florida panhandle (USA), nor likely most of the world's developed coastlines at risk to the effects of climate change. The nourishment of oceanic beaches as historically constructed will surely continue over the next several decades. But, it must be done as an interim strategy during the formulation and implementation of a robust, long-term adaptive management strategy that incorporates managed withdrawal from the coastline.},

@article{stronkhorst_sand_2018,
	abstract = {Coastline retreat is an evident sign of the vulnerability of low-lying sandy coasts to erosion and sea level rise (SLR). Sand nourishments are commonly used to maintain foreshores, beaches, and dunes to preserve their role in flood protection, beach recreation and biodiversity. The feasibility of sand nourishments for long-term maintenance of large-scale coastal systems is hard to determine with detailed numerical morphological models. This study presents a method using a sand nourishment impact model (Ntool) that accounts for repeated sand nourishments over time as well as erosion and SLR impacts on the shoreline position. In Ntool the redistribution of sediment alongshore is based on detailed simulations of the current situation of waves (Delft3D-WAVE) and shoreline development (UNIBEST-CL+).

Two sand nourishment strategies for the period 2010--2100 were evaluated and compared for the ca. 100 km long sandy shores of the Dutch coast (the Netherlands) and the Aveiro coast (Portugal): i) the hold-the-line strategy, in which coastline retreat is directly restored by means of local sand nourishments and ii) the sand balance strategy, in which sand nourishments are applied each five years at high-value locations with volumes equal to the sand deficiencies due to sea level rise plus other known structural sediment losses in a particular sediment cell. Regionalised SLR projections of up to 0.5, 0.7 and 1.9 m by 2100 were taken into account.

Results show that sand nourishments remain a cost-effective method of flood protection for the Dutch coast and are feasible for the centuries to come, even under the high-end SLR scenario, because large sand resources are available in the North Sea. For the Aveiro coast, large-scale sand nourishments might be feasible in combination with a policy of managed retreat for low-value areas to avoid expensive locked-in situations. The sand balance strategy is considered the most practical and has the advantage of economy of scale.},

@article{hinkel_global_2013,
	abstract = {This paper presents a first assessment of the global effects of climate-induced sea-level rise on the erosion of sandy beaches, and its consequent impacts in the form of land loss and forced migration of people. We consider direct erosion on open sandy coasts and indirect erosion near selected tidal inlets and estuaries, using six global mean sea-level scenarios (in the range of 0.2--0.8 m) and six SRES socio-economic development scenarios for the 21st century. Impacts are assessed both without and with adaptation in the form of shore and beach nourishment, based on cost-benefit analysis that includes the benefits of maintaining sandy beaches for tourism. Without nourishment, global land loss would amount to about 6000--17,000 km2 during the 21st century, leading to 1.6--5.3 million people being forced to migrate and migration costs of US\$ 300--1000 billion (not discounted). Optimal beach and shore nourishment would cost about US\$ 65--220 billion (not discounted) during the 21st century and would reduce land loss by 8--14\%, forced migration by 56--68\% and the cost of forced migration by 77--84\% (not discounted). The global share of erodible coast that is nourished increases from about 4\% in 2000 to 18--33\% in 2100, with beach nourishment being 3--4 times more frequent than shore nourishment, reflecting the importance of tourism benefits. In absolute terms, with or without nourishment, large countries with long shorelines appear to have the largest costs, but in relative terms, small island states appear most impacted by erosion. Considerable uncertainty remains due to the limited availability of basic coastal geomorphological data and models on a global scale. Future work should also further explore the effects of beach tourism, including considering sub-national distributions of beach tourists.},

	abstract = {It is predicted that the coastal zone will be among the environments worst affected by projected climate change. Projected losses in beach area will negatively impact on coastal infrastructure and continued recreational use of beaches. Beach nourishment practices such as artificial nourishment, replenishment and scraping are increasingly used to combat beach erosion but the extent and scale of projects is poorly documented in large areas of the world. Through a survey of beach managers of Local Government Areas and a comprehensive search of peer reviewed and grey literature, we assessed the extent of nourishment practices in Australia. The study identified 130 beaches in Australia that were subject to nourishment practices between 2001 and 2011. Compared to projects elsewhere, most Australian projects were small in scale but frequent. Exceptions were nine bypass projects which utilised large volumes of sediment. Most artificial nourishment, replenishment and beach scraping occurred in highly urbanised areas and were most frequently initiated in spring during periods favourable to accretion and outside of the summer season of peak beach use. Projects were generally a response to extreme weather events, and utilised sand from the same coastal compartment as the site of erosion. Management was planned on a regional scale by Local Government Authorities, with little monitoring of efficacy or biological impact. As rising sea levels and growing coastal populations continue to put pressure on beaches a more integrated approach to management is required, that documents the extent of projects in a central repository, and mandates physical and biological monitoring to help ensure the engineering is sustainable and effective at meeting goals.},

	abstract = {The data from 161 quantitative sandy beach transect surveys from a wide variety of locations were examined to identify trends and relationships between total marine macrofauna species richness, abundance, and biomass and physical variables. Several physical variables were correlated, especially sand particle size and beach face slope, and spring tide range and beach face slope. Higher latitudes experienced larger waves, and flatter beaches had finer sands, larger waves, and larger tides. Strong correlations were found between species richness and beach slope, tide range, and sand particle size, as well as various indices of beach state. Tropical regions harbored significantly more species than other regions. A new Beach index (BI), based on tide range, beach face slope, and sand particle size, correlated well with species richness, explaining 56\% of the variability in the data without considering latitude. Abundance and biomass were best correlated with log(1/beach face slope) and tended to be higher in temperate regions. General patterns are discussed; the new index is evaluated; and the roles of sand, tide, slope, and latitude are con- sidered. It is concluded that for regional studies log(1/beach face slope) is the most useful index to compare beaches, whereas for wider comparisons covering areas of differing tide range, BI might be most useful. These patterns have implications for global biodiversity management on sandy beaches.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we examine temporal and spatial beach profile volume changes, sediment budget changes, and side- scan sonar images at nourished beaches of northeastern South Carolina. Results of bulk volume change indicate that most sands eroded from the subaerial beach section remain and circulate within the coastal system. The results also indicate more active sediment exchange between the nearshore and offshore zones than expected, indicating that the offshore can be both a sink and a source for the nearshore morphologic change. Our profile volume change results do not show a unidirectional net southerly transport pattern in the study area during the initial postnourishment period. Instead, results show that the net downdrift direction alternates along the shore and that longshore volume drift patterns are often disrupted by the seaward cross-shore transport events that occur at erosional hotspots. Prenour- ishment erosional patterns, particularly local areas of elevated erosion rates, were re-established after nourishment. Furthermore, those erosional locations often correspond to the offshore locations of paleoriver channel fill sands with low relief, indicating existence of the specific seaward transport pathways along the shore in the study area.},

@article{peterson_exploiting_2006,
	abstract = {Cold-season filling using much coarser sediments than the native caused dramatic suppression of beach macroinvertebrates, demonstrably degrading habitat value for foraging shorebirds. As a dual consequence of persistent steepening of the foreshore, which translated to reduction in habitat area by 14--29\%, and disturbance-induced depression of invertebrate densities on filled beaches, abundances of Donax spp. and haustoriid amphipods averaged less than 10\% of control levels. Donax spp. is the biomass dominant and a key prey for higher trophic levels. Haustoriids lack pelagic larvae. Recovery on filled beaches was not initiated by either taxon during the March--November sampling. Emerita talpoida, an order of magnitude less abundant than Donax spp. on control beaches, exhibited a pattern of initial depression on filled beaches but recovered by mid summer. Polychaetes, mostly the small Scolelepis squamata, experienced a warm-season bloom of equal magnitude on filled and control beaches. Summertime recruitment of predatory ghost crabs appeared inhibited on filled beaches, perhaps by persistent shell hash. Intertidal shell cover on filled beaches averaged 25--50\% in mid summer as compared to 6--8\% on control beaches. Largely in response to prey depression, but perhaps also to surface shell armoring and/or coarsening of sediments, shorebird (mostly sanderling) use plummeted by 70-- 90\% on filled beaches until November. Thus, despite likely adaptations to natural sediment dynamics, the high intensity of sediment deposition, cumulative spatial scope (10.8 km), and unnaturally coarse shelly character of the Bogue Banks beach nourishment resulted in a perturbation that exceeded biotic resistance and degraded the trophic transfer function of this highly productive habitat for at least one warm season.},

@article{schlacher_effects_2012-1,
	abstract = {Beach erosion is likely to accelerate, driven by predicted consequences of climate change and coastal develop- ment. Erosion is increasingly combated by beach nourishment, adding sand to eroding shores. Because a range of engineering techniques exists to nourish beaches, and because these techniques differ in their environmental effects, assessments of ecological impacts need to be tailored and specific. Here we report on impacts and recov- ery of benthic invertebrates impacted by beach nourishment operations undertaken at Palm Beach (SE Queens- land, Australia). Assessments are made based on a beyond-BACI design, where samples were taken once before nourishment and twice afterwards at the impact and two control sites. Because almost all of the sand was depos- ited on the upper beach and later moved with bulldozers down-shore, we specifically examined whether the ef- fects of nourishment varied at different heights of the beach---a little-studied question which has management implications. Impacts on the fauna were massive on the upper and middle levels of the beach: samples collected two days after the conclusion of nourishment were entirely devoid of all invertebrate life (`azoic'), whereas weaker effects of nourishment were detectable on the lower shore. Recovery after five months also varied be- tween shore levels. The sediment of the upper level near the dunes remained azoic, the fauna of the middle shore had recovered partially, and the lower level had recovered in most respects. These findings indicate that the height and position of sand placement are important. For example, rather than depositing fill sand on the in- tertidal beach, it could be placed in the shallow subtidal zone, followed by slow up-shore accretion driven by hy- drodynamic forces. Alternatively, techniques that spread the fill sand in thin layers (to minimize mortality by burial) and leave unfilled intertidal refuge islands (to provide colonists) may minimize the ecological impacts of beach nourishment.},

@article{galgano_long-term_2004,
	abstract = {Along the eastern coast of the United States, groins have been emplaced to stabilize beaches for more than 100 years. The popular assessment of their performance is that they typically have not worked and have caused more problems than they have solved. In many cases, these assessments have been made based upon anecdotal information and without the benefit of long-term shoreline change data. As a consequence, some states and local governments have altogether banned the use of groins as a shoreline protection structure. However, in many circumstances, groins have functioned effectively and stabilized an eroding beach without seriously harming adjacent areas. In the face of beach erosion and property loss, groins combined with beach fill should be available as an option as a beach stabilization system where appropriate. This study employs high-quality, spatially and temporally robust (147-year) shoreline change data to assess the performance a groin field. Historical literature and shoreline change maps were studied at Bethany Beach, Delaware to assess the effectiveness of a groin field built there in the 1930s and 40s. The data illustrate shoreline movements before and after groin emplacement. The results of the analysis suggest that the groins at Bethany Beach were poorly constructed; they required several renovations and were built too short to be truly effective. However, the data also indicate that the groins, in conjunction with beach fill, arrested beach erosion at the site and effectively stabilized the beach for nearly 50-years notwithstanding their structural deficiencies.},

This state is the most populous in the country and 80 percent of its 32 million people live within 50 km of the coast. The conflict between the desire to live on the shore and the inherent geological instability of coastal bluffs, dunes and beaches has produced a risk of significant proportion. As part of the Federal Emergency Management Agency's program to assess the feasibility and economics of including ocean front property in the National Flood Insurance Program, a coastal erosion hazard mapping study was carried out for Santa Cruz County (67 km of both urban and agricultural/open space shoreline in central California) and San Diego County (122 km of heavily urbanized, primarily cliffed, shoreline in southern California). Coastal erosion rates generated using softcopy photogrammetry, geographic information system technology, and aerial photography, reveal that the coastlines of Santa Cruz and San Diego Counties are retreating at average rates of a few centimeters to 60 centimeters per year. The local coastal cliff edge served as the shoreline change reference feature for a majority of the study area and erosion rates were measured by comparing historical shoreline change reference feature position to recent shoreline change reference feature position. The delineation of coastal erosion hazard areas defined as the region between the current position of the shoreline change reference feature and the position as projected 60 years into the future, indicates that numerous structures in Santa Cruz and San Diego County are threatened by coastline retreat.},

Beach nourishment creates a wider beach which has the relative effect of displacing a structure landward, thus reducing the forces on the structure. The storm damage potential reduction due to beach nourishment is demonstrated through simulating wave breaking over unnourished and nourished profiles. The wave breaking model of Dally is utilized to represent wave transformation with the maximum drag force on a piling serving as a measure of damage potential. Wave height transformation and associated damage potential are demonstrated for several profiles, including an idealized monotonic profile, a profile with a nourishment mound present and a profile which has responded to storm water levels and waves. It is shown, consistent with field documentation, that the greatest benefits per unit of additional beach width are provided for the initial additional beach widths.},

@article{jackson_geological_2005,
	abstract = {The concept of beach morphodynamic states has achieved widespread acceptance in the coastal geological literature since its inception in the mid-1980s and expansion in the 1990s. Much of the pioneering work was undertaken in Australia under a range of environmental conditions in microtidal environments and a close empirical relationship between beach 3-dimensional morphology and the Dean's parameter (Hb/WsT) was established. Subsequently, the Relative Tidal Range parameter (Hb/TR) was extended to beaches of all tidal ranges.

In this paper, observations are presented from 25 beaches around the north coast of Ireland. These beaches exist on an environmental gradient that encompasses marked tidal and wave energy variability (micro to macrotidal and low to high wave energy). Each beach was visually categorised into one of several established beach states described in the literature, on the basis of field observations. For each beach, the RTR and Dean's parameter were calculated for the immediately antecedent period and used to predict the beach state using published relationships. Observed and predicted beach states were then compared.

Comparison of observed and predicted beach states showed that while beaches with observed dissipative morphology typically matched the expected criteria, most other beach states did not. Lack of agreement between predicted and observed beach states has been reported elsewhere and attributed to failings in the RTR and Dean's parameter. In addition, this study identifies geological factors as important constraints on actual beach state. In the majority of beaches studied, inherited geological factors appear to be more important determinants of beach morphology than contemporary dynamics.},

Our findings support this hypothesis, as extending the influence of beach quality beyond 300 m from the shore generally results in statistically insignificant parameter estimates.

Applying pixel-based supervised classification, we found that 31\% of the world's ice-free shoreline are sandy. The application of an automated shoreline detection method to the sandy shorelines thus identified resulted in a global dataset of shoreline change rates for the 33 year period 1984--2016. Analysis of the satellite derived shoreline data indicates that 24\% of the world's sandy beaches are eroding at rates exceeding 0.5 m/yr, while 28\% are accreting and 48\% are stable. The majority of the sandy shorelines in marine protected areas are eroding, raising cause for serious concern.},

The linear regression statistical function of the Shoreline Shape and Projection Program (SSAPP) was used to calculate the average annual rate of shoreline change at shorenormal transects spaced 150 ft apart along the shore and to estimate the position of the erosion reference feature and associated flood hazard zones in 60 years. Results of our investigation show that (1) beach morphology, shoreline movement, and the regional geologic framework are closely interrelated, (2) Gulf beaches are generally retreating, (3) rates of retreat have accelerated locally, and (4) the degree of dune and backbeach modification is correlated with the intensity of beach scraping. The field surveys and statistical analyses also demonstrate that (1) the high water line (HWL) mapped on T-sheets and aerial photographs undergoes large seasonal fluctuations and therefore is a less reliable indicator of shoreline position than the vegetation line, berm crest, crest of washover terrace, or backbeach erosional scarp, and (2) the shape of the projected shoreline is so sensitive to perturbations in the 1996 shoreline that long-term projections tend to produce unrealistic results. GPS field monitoring of shoreline change reference features that are more stable than the HWL has the potential of greatly reducing the unexplained variability in shoreline position (error) and ultimately improving the accuracy and reliability of shoreline position models.},

Beach nourishment performance at annual temporal and kilometer spatial scales within the microtidal low-wave energy barrier island coast is most significantly influenced by the interruption of longshore sediment transport by complex tidal-inlet processes. The inlet processes directly influencing adjacent beach nourishment performance include longshore transport interruption resulting from divergence induced by wave refraction over an ebb-tidal shoal, flood-tidal currents along the beach, and total littoral blockage by structured inlets. Secondary factors controlling the nourishment performance include project length and width, shoreline orientation, and antecedent geology. A morphologic indicator of a large longshore transport gradient within the study area is the absence of a nearshore sandbar. These non-barred beaches are characterized by persistent shoreline erosion. The presence of a sandbar indicates the dominance of cross-shore processes, with bar migration in response to wave condition variations and a relatively stable shoreline. The entirety of a barrier island system should be considered when evaluating the performance of a nourishment.},

@article{van_tomme_macrofaunal_2013,
	abstract = {Nowadays, beach nourishment is widely considered as a better alternative compared to the construction of hard structures to protect a sandy coast against detrimental erosive effects, both from an ecological and an engineering perspective. The rare studies conducted on the ecological impact of beach nourishment are short-term, post hoc monitoring investigations of the benthic macrofauna. Little is known of the biological processes during and after nourishment. To allow swift recolonization after nourishment, the characteristics of the nourished beach have to match the habitat demands of the benthic macrofauna. The sediment preference of the key intertidal species Scolelepis squamata, Eurydice pulchra, Bathyporeia pilosa and Bathyporeia sarsi, which dominate many West European sandy beaches, was investigated through laboratory experiments, both in single-species as well as combined-species treatments. While the former aimed at developing guidelines for impact mitigation of beach nourishment, the latter aimed at elucidating the role of biotic interactions in sediment preference. Results of the experiments indicated that B. pilosa and E. pulchra prefer the finest sediment, while B. sarsi had a broader preference and also occurred in medium-coarse sediments. However, the sediment preference of E. pulchra for fine sediments was not confirmed by other field and experimental studies. The polychaete S. squamata had the broadest preference and even showed a high occurrence in coarse sediments that are not naturally occurring on the sandy beaches where the animals were caught for this experiment. However, this polychaete is a cosmopolitan species, not only occurring on fine-grained beaches, but also on coarse-grained beaches worldwide. The preferences imply that beach nourishment with coarse sediment will have a major effect on B. pilosa while effects of coarse sediments on S. squamata will be minor. Finally, interspecific competition with the sympatrically occurring amphipod B. sarsi was found to change the sediment selection of the amphipod B. pilosa towards the coarser sediments where B. sarsi occurred in lower frequencies.},

E talpoida populations increase in density across the foreshore toward the lower part of the beach (step). High density cells frequently lie within areas of reduced wave energy, such as in the troughs of beach cusps. The depth at which Emerita occur within the sediment of the upper beach is rarely more than 5 cm. Their numbers increase and they burrow deeper toward the lower part of the beach. Structures extending across the foreshore, such as the research pier used in this study, modify wave action and thus cause redistribution of beach sediment and beach morphology. This, in turn, results in modifications of E. talpoida distributions. Onshore migration of the overwintering population occurred in early April during a period of rapidly increasing water temperature. Numbers increased through spring and summer to a seasonal maximum in late summer and early fall. Large and rapid fluctuations in the population are superimposed on the seasonal cycle. These fluctuations are related to variations in wave energy and tide level, and reflect onshore and offshore migration in response to energy conditions and feeding requirements.},

Five species, in order of abundance, Bathyporeia parkeri, Parahaustorius longimerus, Eudevenopus honduranus, Rhepoxynius epistomus, and Parahaustorius holmesi, made up 90\% of total amphipod abundance. Only 1.5\% of total amphipod abundance was found in the intertidal zone in this study, in marked contrast to other studies of sand-beach amphipods on the east coast of the United States. Abundance and species richness of amphipods increased sharply just below the swash zone. This spatial pattern is consistent with the hypothesis of Dahl (1953) that intertidal amphipods should become a less abundant component of the fauna on tropical beaches as compared to temperate ones. Strong seasonal patterns of abundance and species richness are present, with lowest values in the winter months. This temporal pattern does not appear to correlate with predator activity.},

	abstract = {Quantitative samples of benthic macrofauna were collected seasonally from sandy beaches and adjacent nearshore areas bordering the entrance of a high salinity inlet in South Carolina. Intertidal stations were numerically dominated by the polychaete Scolelepis squamata, the amphipod Neohaustorius schmitzi and the bivalve Donax variabilis. Abundant subtidal species included the polychaetes Spiophanes bombyx and Scolelepis squamata, the amphipods Protohaustorius deichmannae and Acanthohaustorius millsi, and the bivalve Tellina sp. Species composition, faunal density and species diversity varied along three transects extending from mean high water to depths of about 5 m. Although some species groups were habitat-restricted, the numerically dominant species were widely distributed throughout the subtidal and intertidal zones. Polychaetes dominated the fauna of subtidal and intertidal habitats, both in terms of numbers of species and numbers of individuals. This dominance was attributed to the moderate wave energy in this area, as well as to the sheltering effect of a jetty that was constructed during the course of the study. Jetty construction also resulted in faunal enrichment at intertidal stations on a sheltered transect.},

@article{mclachlan_zonation_1995,
	abstract = {The zonation of macrobenthic fauna on intertidal sandy beaches of open coasts is reviewed. Two major zonation schemes have been in use: a tripartite division of the shore, defined biologically, and a subdivision into four zones based on physical changes across the intertidal. Published accounts of zonation are evaluated in terms of these two schemes for South America, Central and North America, Africa, Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific, Europe and Asia. Most accounts are uncritical descriptions of zonation in three bands: supralittoral, eulittoral and lower-shore/subtidal. Recent studies suggest that zonation varies between beach types, fewer zones being present on reflective than dissipative beaches, because of the absence of fauna on the lower shore in the former. Many communities exhibit marked temporal variability, often coupled to seasons and reflected in changing zonation patterns. Rhythmic behaviour also varies and determines zonation. This is best developed in crustaceans, which display marked circatidal rhythms in the midshore, but also circadian rhythms, especially in the supralittoral and sublittoral, and sometimes weak circasemi-lunar rhythms. Intraspecific zonation by size has been recorded in many species (especially bivalves), juveniles being located above adults in some cases and below them in others. Competition and predation generally exert limited influence on zonation on open sandy shores. It is concluded that zonation on sandy beaches is dynamic and variable, usually being most distinct at the top of the shore and becoming less clear down shore. Three zones appear to be generally valid, the lower zones tending to disappear towards reflective beach states, but becoming more complex towards macrotidal dissipative conditions.},

@article{brown_sandy_2002,
	abstract = {Pollution, mining, disruption of sand transport and tourism development widely affect sandy shores, and these systems may be subject to increased erosion in future, yet there have been few attempts to review them. The present review focuses largely on ocean sandy beaches, providing an introduction to much of the relevant literature, and predicting possible states of the system by 2025. Sandy shores are dynamic harsh environments, the action of waves and tides largely determining species diversity, biomass and community structure. There is an interchange of sand, biological matter and other materials between dunes, intertidal beaches and surf zones. Storms and associated erosion present the most substantial universal hazard to the fauna. Human-related perturbations vary from beach to beach; however, structures or activities that impede natural sand transport or alter the sand budget commonly lead to severe erosion, often of a permanent nature. Many beaches also suffer intermittent or chronic pollution, and direct human interference includes off-road vehicles, mining, trampling, bait collecting, beach cleaning and ecotourism. These interferences typically have a negative impact on the system. Identified long-term trends include chronic beach erosion, often largely due to natural causes, as well as increased ultraviolet (UV) radiation and changes related to global warming. It is not expected that predicted temperature changes will have dramatic effects on the world's beaches by 2025, but the expected rise in sea level, if coupled with an increase in the frequency and/or intensity of storms, as predicted for some regions, is likely to lead to escalating erosion and consequent loss of habitat. It is suggested that increased UV radiation is unlikely to have significant effects. Increases in coastal human populations and tourism, thus increasing pressure on the shore, while serious, may be largely offset in developed and developing countries by better management resulting from greater understanding of the factors governing sandy-shore systems and better communication with beach managers and developers. Beach Human pressures in many underdeveloped countries show no signs of being mitigated by conservation measures; it is likely that their sandy shores will continue to deteriorate during the first quarter of this century. A long-term trend that cannot be ignored is the excessive amount of nitrogen entering the sea, particularly affecting beaches in estuaries and sheltered lagoons. The data presently available and the uncertainty of a number of predictions do not permit of quantitative assessment or modelling of the state of the world's sandy shores by the year 2025, but some tentative, qualitative predictions are offered.},

	abstract = {Dredging and dumping of dredged sediments in estuarine and coastal waters may lead to increased turbidity and enhanced sediment deposition at dump sites. This mainly affects primary production by phytoplankton, performance of visual predators (e.g. fish, birds), and growth and survival of benthic organisms. This paper combines a compilation of literature information and results of additional experimental studies on the effect of enhanced concentrations of suspended matter (SPM) on growth of bivalve molluscs, and on survival of macro- and meiozoobenthos after dumping of dredged sediments. Furthermore, it focuses on non-toxic dredged sediments only.

Release of nutrients from dredged sediments did, so far, hardly influence estuarine phytoplankton production. Increased turbidity may affect dab as well as prey location by sandwich terns. Enhanced SPM-concentrations are unfavourable for young herring and smelt. Growth of filter-feeding bivalves may be impaired, especially at SPM-concentrations {\textgreater}250 mg/l. Estuarine nematodes can survive burial by 10 cm of dumped dredged sediment provided that its physical characteristics are similar to those of the original sediment. Sessile benthos organisms such as mussels and oysters can cope with sediment deposition of only 1--2 cm. Other macrozoobenthos can survive sediment deposition of 20--30 cm. Recovery of benthos at a dump site will occur if the interval between successive dumpings is sufficiently long.
Options for management of dumping of dredged sediments are described, relating to different locations of dump sites in estuarine and coastal waters, to different seasons, and to the actual use (area and frequency) of dump sites.},

@article{gorzelany_effects_1987,
	abstract = {Changes in the benthic fauna of the near-shore zone were examined before and after a beach replenishment project on the central Florida east coast. Results indicated that the near-shore sand beach community is relatively species rich, although abundance is dominated by only two species of bivalves, the coquina clams Donax variabilis and Donax parvula. Strong gradients of increased species richness and abundance were found, with values increasing at the more seaward sites for both control and nourishment locations. This distributional pattern was unchanged by beach nourishment. Comparison of mean number of individuals per core across dates and among transects (two-way analysis of variance) showed no indication of significant negative effects of beach nourishment. Similar analysis for mean number of species per core also failed to show significant negative effects. Negative biological effects of beach nourishment may have been minimized in the present case due to a seasonal offshore movement of the dominant coquina clams. The close match of mean fill grain size to ambient grain size and an apparent lack of substantial fill movement into the biologically more diverse offshore areas may also have diminished biological damage.},

Coarse sand in the tailings greatly increases the grain size of the affected parts of the beach and thereby provides the opportunity to assess the effects of changing sand grain size on a beach when other physical variables are kept constant. Elizabeth Bay (Namibia) is 4 km long and was originally composed of fine sand which, exposed to moderate to heavy wave action, produced a log spiral bay with a dissipative beach. Tailings disposal in the centre of the bay has increased mean sand particle size from original values of 110 to 160 um to present values of 500 to 800 um with a concomitant conversion of beach morphodynamic state from dissipative to intermediate. Surveys of the 2 ends of the bay, which are relatively unaffected by disposal, and of an undisturbed similar bay nearby revealed intertidal benthic macrofauna communities with 15 to 20 species occurring in high abundance (24120 to 129276 m-1). In 3 transects in the affected area, species richness was 8 to 12 per transect and abundance was 640 to 4710 m-1. Beds of the large sand mussel Donax serra have disappeared from the affected sector of the bay and peracarids typical of finer sands have been replaced by a more robust species. Regression analysis revealed significant correlations between community parameters (species richness and abundance) and both beach slope and particle size; ANOVA confirmed the significantly lower abundances of fauna in the affected areas. Smothering effects appeared to be localised and limited. This study has supported the hypothesis that an increase in sand particle size (on a beach where tide range and wave energy have remained constant) results in a change in beach state and a decrease in species richness and abundance.},

In some areas they are very productive and are exploited commercially. However, they have been regarded as marine deserts by many biologists and were largely neglected until Remane (1933) began studies on the coasts of Germany. The work of Pearse et al (1942) was also pioneering and represented the first qualitative attempt to evaluate a whole beach system. Since then sandy beach ecology has advanced considerably, though it has always lagged behind other aspects of coastal marine ecology in the attention it has enjoyed. During this period biological research on beaches has spread from early taxonomic and qualitative studies through quantitative ecology and physiology of important species towards a more holistic systems approach today.},

@article{mclachlan_ecology_1991,
	abstract = {The distinguishing feature of coastal dunes is their connection to the shore. This maritime influence results in most coastal dunefields exhibiting a marked shore-normal gradient of decreasing physical stress and increasing complexity and vegetation cover landwards. Physical stresses include sand movement, salt spray, temperature variability, wind and disturbances such as storms. Increasing vegetation cover, often coupled to succession, mediates physical stress, creates stable microenvironments and is responsible for a general increase in habitat complexity landwards. Fauna respond to this gradient in a number of ways. Crustaceans of marine origin decrease in abundance landwards. Many of the special adaptations, which equip fauna for psammophilic lifestyles and allow them to cope with salt spray and temperature extremes, are only encountered near the beach. Insects, vertebrates and interstitial fauna increase in abundance landwards as vegetation cover, height and diversity increase, soil develops and greater stability is attained. Biological interactions and impacts of fauna on vegetation via grazing, seed dispersal and disturbance also increase landwards. There may be a shift from primarily r-strategist species near the beach to k-strategists inland and birds may replace small mammals as vegetation height increases. Coastal dune fauna differs from that of deserts in being more diverse and having a well developed interstitial component. Furthermore, coastal dune inhabitants are less specialised to cope with physical extremes and are seldom unique or endemic to these systems. However, this fauna has received considerably less attention than that of desert dunes and much research is warranted on subjects such as adaptations to sand movement and salt spray, endemism, trophic relations and exchanges with adjacent systems. Wind is the major factor impinging on these dune ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Ten sandy beaches along the north coast of Spain were studied during September 1999 to analyse the number of species, abundance and biomass of macroinfauna along a gradient of intermediate beach types and exposure range. Faunal samples were collected with metallic cylinders (25 cm diameter, 15 cm depth) at 10 equally spaced shore levels along six replicated transects separated randomly and extending from above the drift line to the low tide swash zone. Exposure rate, Dean's parameter (Ω), beach state index (BSI) and relative tidal range (RTR) were estimated at each beach. Length and width of the beach, intertidal slope, sorting and median grain size and also swash amplitude and wave characteristics were measured. The number of species was between 10 and 29. Macrofaunal abundances ranged between 4962 and 71,228 ind. linear m−1 and between 31 and 329 ind. m−2, while biomass (ash free dry weight) ranged between 0.027 and 0.278 g m−2 and between 3 and 61 g linear m−1. The results show some significant trends: the number of species is the biotic variable most affected by physical and morphodynamic factors, increasing linearly with relative tidal range and decreasing with increasing average grain size. The same trend was observed from exposed to very exposed beaches and the biomass decreased exponentially with increasing average grain size. These trends agree with previous studies in different coasts in the world where coarse sands limit the benthic macrofauna. The morphodynamic parameters as Dean's parameter or Beach State Index did not show a predictive value. The results suggest that different characteristics of benthic macrofauna communities in intermediate beaches can be affected in different ways by the physical processes involved in beach morphodynamics.},

@article{witmer_examination_2019,
	abstract = {Urban sandy beaches are often extensively modified by human activities such as nourishment projects. Such disturbances can significantly alter ecosystem structure, making it difficult to understand the ``natural state''. Macrofaunal species are greatly influenced by direct sediment influx which may bury organisms that are unable to dig out quickly or relocate seaward. In this study we sampled the nearshore macrofaunal community in association to grain size on two beaches that are not directly nourished to help determine a ``natural'' state community. Macrofaunal samples were taken at four levels, two intertidal and two subtidal. Eighty overall samples were taken per beach. Cores were additionally taken at each level for geological analyses. The two beaches were found to differ both geologically (intertidally) and by macrofaunal community. Sediment grain size was highest in the intertidal levels at both beaches. Gulfstream Park's intertidal zone possessed the largest grain-sized and most poorly sorted sediments. Gulfstream Park's macrofaunal richness was greater at 17 taxa compared to MacArthur Beach State Park's 5 taxa. From the 19 identified taxa 5 species constituted 83\% of the macrofaunal community, with the isopod Ancinus depressus being the most common organism (32\%). Community differences between the two beaches were attributed to greater sediment disturbance at Gulfstream Park. Macrofaunal species are important low-level consumers in coastal food webs. Changes to macrofaunal communities transmit to higher trophic levels and may potentially impact on human beach activities (e.g. fishing, nature watching).},

@article{kimbro_disturbance_2006,
	abstract = {Foundation species in space-limited systems can increase diversity by creating habitat, but they may also reduce diversity by excluding primary space competitors. These contrasting forces of increasing associate diversity and suppressing competitor diversity have rarely been examined experimentally with respect to disturbance. In a benthic marine community in central California, where native oysters are a foundation species, we tested how disturbance influenced overall species richness, evenness, and diversity. Surprisingly, overall diversity did not peak across a disturbance gradient because, as disturbance decreased, decreases in overall species evenness opposed increases in overall species richness. Decreasing disturbance intensity (high oyster abundance) led to increasing species richness of sessile and mobile species combined. This increase was due to the facilitation of secondary sessile and mobile species in the presence of oysters. In contrast, decreasing disturbance intensity and high oyster abundance decreased the evenness of sessile and mobile species. Three factors likely contributed to this decreased evenness: oysters reduced abundances of primary sessile species due to space competition; oysters supported more rare mobile species; and oysters disproportionately increased the relative abundance of a few common mobile species. Our results highlight the need for further studies on how disturbance can differentially affect the evenness and richness of different functional groups, and ultimately how these differences affect the relationship between overall diversity and ecosystem function. Key words: biodiversity; competition; foundation species; intermediate disturbance hypothesis; mobile species; Olympia oysters; positive interactions; species richness and evenness.},
